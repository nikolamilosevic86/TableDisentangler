However, the durability of such control remains unclear. Here we present longitudinal follow-up of a single-arm, open-label study assessing the impact of STI in the setting of acute HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Fourteen patients were treated during acute HIV-1 infection and subsequently subjected to an STI protocol that required retreatment if viral load exceeded 50,000 RNA copies/ml plasma or remained above 5,000 copies/ml for more than three consecutive weeks. Eleven of 14 (79&#x00025;) patients were able to achieve viral loads of less than 5,000 RNA copies/ml for at least 90 d following one, two, or three interruptions of treatment. However, a gradual increase in viremia and decline in CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts was observed in most individuals. By an intention-to-treat analysis, eight (57&#x00025;), six (43&#x00025;), and three (21&#x00025;) of 14 patients achieved a maximal period of control of 180, 360, and 720 d, respectively, despite augmentation of HIV-specific CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses. The magnitude of HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses before treatment interruption did not predict duration of viremia control. The small sample size and lack of concurrent untreated controls preclude assessment of possible clinical benefit despite failure to control viremia by study criteria.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data indicate that despite initial control of viremia, durable viral control to less than 5,000 RNA copies/ml plasma in patients following treated acute HIV-1 infection occurs infrequently. Determination of whether early treatment leads to overall clinical benefit will require a larger and randomized clinical trial. These data may be relevant to current efforts to develop an HIV-1 vaccine designed to retard disease progression rather than prevent infection since they indicate that durable maintenance of low-level viremia may be difficult to achieve.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Long-term follow-up of 14 patients on HAART during acute infection followed by supervised treatment interruptions shows that most failed to achieve lasting control of viremia.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can dramatically prolong the life of individuals infected by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;, but early hopes for virus eradication have not been realized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

The main hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection followed by STI would lead to immune boosting and subsequent control of viremia without the need for drugs. The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound above 50,000 copies/ml once or above 5,000 copies for three determinations separated by a week each.

The current study investigates the frequency and durability of control achieved with this intervention, with follow-up to a median of 5.3 y after infection, and with an increase in size of the cohort to 14 patients. Our results indicate that, although the majority of patients treated in the acute phase of infection go on to control HIV-1 to less than 5,000 RNA copies/ml plasma for at least 6 mo off therapy, the ability to contain viremia below this level over the long term is maintained in a minority of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objective</title><p>The hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection would confer immunologic maturation and subsequent control of HIV-1 without the need for ongoing drug therapy. Alternatively, if a breakthrough of virus replication was observed, this would provide a boost in HIV-1-specific immunity after reinstitution of antiviral therapy. The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound to more than 50,000 copies/ml or viral loads above 5,000 copies/ml for three determinations separated by a week each. The secondary objective was to correlate immunologic and virologic parameters with any observed effects including evolution of HIV-1-specific T helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses.

Patients underwent successive treatment interruptions after an initial treatment period of at least 8 mo (median, 508 d; range, 245&#x02013;1,096 d) and were required to restart therapy when viral load exceeded 50,000 RNA copies/ml plasma on a single occasion, or 5,000 copies/ml for three consecutive weeks. For purposes of analysis, patients who dropped out of the study or who reinitiated therapy without meeting criteria were considered to have lost the ability to contain viremia.</p><p>Using these criteria for reinitiation of therapy and to define failure, 11 of 14 patients (79&#x00025;) were able to achieve virologic control to less than 5,000 RNA copies/ml plasma for at least 90 d after one, two, or three treatment interruptions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010036-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Duration of viremia control during successive treatment interruptions was highly variable, and there was no increase in the sustainability of viral containment during successive STI cycles.

A paired comparison (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test) showed no significant difference in the length of viremia control with subsequent treatment interruptions. Although patients experienced rebound viremia with discontinuation of therapy, none of the patients experienced recurrence of symptoms associated with acute HIV-1 infection.</p><p>These data show that at least transient control of viremia to less than 5,000 RNA copies/ml plasma was achieved in the majority of study participants during at least one of the treatment interruptions, but that durable viral control in participants following treated acute infection occurred infrequently.

Early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection led to normalization of CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts in most patients (median, 753 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 492&#x02013;986), but the effect of treatment interruption was variable, even in those doing well, as defined by sustained low viral loads. Overall, 11 of 14 patients interrupted therapy for at least 12 mo, and these individuals were evaluated regarding the effect of treatment interruption on CD4&#x0002b; T cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010036-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010036-g002">2</xref>C). The rate of change in CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts during the first year of the longest period off treatment ranged from &#x0002b;157 to &#x02212;438 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/y (median, &#x02212;192). Of the three patients who did not meet viral load criteria for restarting therapy for more than 2 y, one (AC-02) had an increasing CD4&#x0002b; T cell count of 157 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/y, one (AC-10) had a stable CD4&#x0002b; T cell count (&#x02212;9 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/y) , and one (AC-14) experienced a decline of 344 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/y.

Analysis of CD4&#x0002b; T cell decline during the second year for the three individuals who controlled viremia for more than 2 y revealed similar trends in CD4&#x0002b; T cell slopes, although they were less steep: AC-02, &#x0002b;88 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/y; AC-10, &#x0002b;44 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/y; and AC-14, &#x02212;110 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/y. When the first 3 mo off therapy were excluded in order to minimize the potential effects of recent treatment on CD4&#x0002b; T cell number, the rate of change in CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts during the first year off therapy no longer differed statistically from the MACS data (median, &#x02212;207 cell/mm<sup>3</sup>/y; range, &#x0002b;119 to &#x02212;699; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>p =</italic> 0.07).

All patients presented with symptomatic acute infection. Time between onset of symptoms and institution of therapy did not affect duration of control following STI (Cox proportional hazards regression model, <italic>p &#x0003e;</italic> 0.05). The individuals who controlled viremia for a longer time either during the first STI or during any of the treatment interruptions were not different from those who experienced earlier breakthrough as measured by ELISA and Western blot status at initiation of HAART, coreceptor polymorphisms (CCR5delta32, CCR2 V64I), or the presence or absence of GBV-C coinfection (Cox proportional hazards model, <italic>p &#x0003e;</italic> 0.05 in all comparisons; data not shown). The only parameter that was predictive of prolonged viral control during the first treatment interruption was a low viremia at time of institution of therapy (<italic>p =</italic> 0.01): there was a 2.8-fold increase in hazard per order of magnitude increase in viral load. This factor was no longer predictive when the period of longest control of viremia was considered. The time to rebound of viremia (&#x0003e;50 copies/ml or &#x0003e;400 copies/ml) did not correlate with the duration of viral control.

At the beginning of the first STI, HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells were weak (median of 590 SFCs/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010036-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and narrowly directed at a median of two epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010036-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses increased significantly (<italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.05) during the first off-treatment period, reaching a median total magnitude of 2,725 SFCs/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs and targeting a median of eight epitopes, and then were sustained when therapy was reintroduced. A further increase in the magnitude and breadth of HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells was observed in the subsequent off-treatment periods, although these augmentations failed to reach statistical significance. The CD8&#x0002b; T cell&#x02013;mediated immune responses emerging during these consecutive cycles of treatment interruption were broadly directed, targeting all structural and most accessory and regulatory HIV-1 gene products (data not shown). However, the magnitude of HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses at the beginning of the first (<italic>r =</italic> 0.01, <italic>p =</italic> 0.76), second (<italic>r =</italic> 0.16, <italic>p =</italic> 0.54), or third (<italic>r =</italic> 0.1, <italic>p =</italic> 0.55) treatment interruptions was not predictive of the time the study participants were subsequently able to stay off therapy according to study criteria.</p><p>The periods off treatment allowed for assessment of the relationship between exposure to virus and evolution of immune responses. There was a highly significant positive association between time until virologic failure during the first treatment interruption and change in the magnitude of HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses (<italic>r =</italic> 0.92, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010036-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

The increase in CD8&#x0002b; T cell epitopes targeted during the first treatment interruption was also linearly correlated to the duration until virological failure (<italic>r =</italic> 0.81, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010036-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). However, no significant relationship was observed between the augmentation of epitopes targeted during the second and third treatment pauses and the time the study participants were able to remain off therapy in the respective treatment interruption. These data suggest that the duration of a treatment interruption, and therefore the duration of exposure to plasma virus, correlates positively with the magnitude and breadth of HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses that emerge during off-therapy time periods. Yet, CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses prior to treatment interruptions were not significantly predictive of the duration of time that patients are able to spontaneously control HIV-1 replication, as defined by the study criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Relationship of Magnitude of Lymphocyte Proliferative Responses to p24 Antigen to Duration of Viremia Control</title><p>We next analyzed evolution of lymphoproliferative responses to recombinant HIV-1 p24 Gag protein in order to assess HIV-1-specific CD4&#x0002b; T cell function.

During treatment interruptions, there was a variable decline in magnitude, and comparisons between responses on the first day of treatment interruption and last day off therapy did not reach statistical significance (first STI, <italic>p =</italic> 0.72; second, <italic>p =</italic> 0.12; and third, <italic>p =</italic> 0.60, respectively).

Here we analyzed the long-term impact of initiation of antiviral therapy during acute HIV-1 infection followed by STIs in a cohort of 14 patients. Although initial control of viremia to less than 5,000 RNA copies/ml plasma was achieved in the majority of the individuals studied, a gradual increase in viremia and decline in CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts was observed in most patients, even after a year or more of viral containment. Durable virologic control occurred infrequently, despite the presence of robust HIV-1-specific CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses detected by standard assays. Moreover, even during periods of successful control of viremia, progressive loss of CD4&#x0002b; T cells was frequently observed. These data indicate that although early treatment of acute and early infection is frequently associated with transient control of viremia after STI, ongoing low-level viral replication is associated with ultimate virologic breakthrough in most patients.</p><p>The standard immunologic assays and virologic assessments in this cohort revealed considerable heterogeneity among the study participants, and did not show a consistent pattern in duration of viremia control during successive treatment interruptions. Eleven of 14 patients (79&#x00025;) were able to maintain a viral load of less than 5,000 copies/ml for at least 90 d, but progressive loss of control ensued in the majority of patients and only three patients (21&#x00025;) were able to maintain control for more than 2 y. These three patients did so during the first (AC-10), the second (AC-02), and the third (AC-14) STI. Clinical, genetic, and immunological parameters did not distinguish these three individuals from the other 11 patients, nor did they predict the duration of control following treatment interruption. Indeed, the longer a patient was off therapy, the stronger and more broadly directed the CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses became, but these were still not sufficient to maintain prolonged control in most patients. Although three patients did not complete the study as initially intended (patient AC-45 withdrew from the study after viral breakthrough on the first STI, AC-13 restarted therapy despite a viral load of less than 5,000 copies/ml during both the first and second STIs and then withdrew, and AC-05 restarted therapy prematurely during the second STI but then failed to control during the third STI), the results are not substantially different if these three are censored rather than considered to have failed to control.</p><p>Loss of viral control in this cohort occurred not only in the presence of strong CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses, but in most cases also in the presence of virus-specific CD4&#x0002b; T cell responses, although the CD4&#x0002b; T cell responses often declined during periods of viremia. In addition, total CD4&#x0002b; T cell numbers were also monitored and declined in most patients over time, including one of the three patients who were able to maintain low viral loads for at least 2 y. Mechanisms leading to rapid CD4&#x0002b; T cell loss need to be further studied in future STI trials.

The only parameter found to be associated with longer control of viremia during the first treatment interruption was a lower viral load at time of institution of antiviral therapy. Given the multiplicity of comparisons made, the true significance of this finding is uncertain.</p><p>The reasons for progressive loss of control despite augmentation of virus-specific CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses remain to be defined. In one individual (AC-06), HIV-1 superinfection in the setting of strong and broadly directed HIV-specific cellular immune responses was associated with the loss of viral control, as previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;. No other cases of superinfection have been identified in these patients (data not shown). The immunologic studies performed failed to show an association between increases in viral load and loss of immune responses, but this may be due to the use of the current standard IFN-&#x003b3; assays to quantify immune function. Numerous studies now indicate that IFN-&#x003b3; production alone is not associated with viral load &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d; but rather that functional characteristics of CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; T cells may be better associated with viral control &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Such studies will be important to pursue. In particular, even a low level of viremia correlates with a low or undetectable frequency of interleukin-2-producing HIV-1-specific memory CD4&#x0002b; T cells endowed with proliferative capacity in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;, thus abrogating CD4&#x0002b; T cell help crucial to maintain efficacy of CD8&#x0002b; T cell functions. In an interim study of a subset of six of the 14 patients presented here (patients AC-02, AC-05, AC-14, AC-15, AC-25, and AC-46), a fully differentiated effector phenotype of HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells for selected epitopes was found to be associated with better control of viremia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Virus sequencing studies currently in progress in this cohort indicate that viral breakthrough is associated with sequence changes within and outside known CTL epitopes (data not shown).

In chronic HIV-1 infection, STI studies showed only marginal, if any, improvements of HIV-1 viremia control following a number of treatment interruptions cycles, despite at least transient increases in HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; and CD4&#x0002b; T cell responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b55">55</xref>&#x0005d;.

Other studies of STI after treated acute HIV-1 infection have shown limited benefits &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;, including recent trials such as the PrimSTOP trial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b57">57</xref>&#x0005d; and the QUEST study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b58">58</xref>&#x0005d;. However, little is known about the relationship between scheduling of HAART and treatment interruptions and the characteristics of viral rebound after therapy has been discontinued.</p><p>Although durable control of viremia was not achieved, it is noteworthy that the majority of patients were able to achieve transient relative containment of viremia, providing rationale for future studies aimed at further enhancing immune control. Early treatment alone should still be considered an important therapeutic option. Therapeutic vaccinations administered after treated acute HIV-1 infection and before cessation of therapy have given disappointing results thus far &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;, but the availability of new and more potent immunogens requires reassessment of this approach. Indeed, the ability to enhance CD4&#x0002b; T helper cell responses in the chronic phase of infection has been demonstrated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b59">59</xref>&#x0005d;, but whether this will enhance CD8&#x0002b; T cell function requires additional studies. Some promising results have been obtained using immunomodulatory drugs, including cyclosporine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b60">60</xref>&#x0005d; and hydroxyurea &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b61">61</xref>&#x0005d;, in combination with antiviral therapy, presumably because of the limitation of T cell activation. Administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blunted the viral rebound following interruption of HAART, and largely prevented a decrease of CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts in an STI trial in chronic HIV-1 infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b62">62</xref>&#x0005d;. These additional therapeutic interventions deserve further investigation in future STI studies.</p><p>Although the present study shows progressive viral breakthrough, it was not designed to address whether there might be a change in set point viremia achieved or overall clinical benefit through transient early treatment of acute HIV infection. The definition of failure chosen for this study was a viral load of greater than 5,000 RNA copies/ml plasma, which at the time the study was initiated corresponded to the level of viremia at which treatment was recommended. Larger randomized trials will be needed to determine the potential clinical and virologic benefit of approaches based on STIs. In studies of untreated infection, there is only a 5-fold difference in viremia separating the quartile with the slowest disease progression from the quartile with the most rapid progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0010036-b63">63</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that small differences in steady-state viremia may influence clinical outcome. In the meantime, STI probably should be avoided outside the setting of controlled clinical trials. The data in this study may also be relevant to current efforts to develop a therapeutic AIDS vaccine designed to retard disease progression rather than prevent infection, since they suggest that durable maintenance of low-level viremia may be difficult to achieve.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>Study Protocol</title><p>(68 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0010036.sd001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd002"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><title>Protocol Amendment</title><p>(47 KB PDF).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0010036.sd002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd003"><label>Protocol S3</label><caption><title>Patient Consent Form</title><p>(187 KB PDF).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0010036.sd003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd004"><label>Protocol S4</label><caption><title>Institutional Review Board Approval</title><p>(36 KB PDF).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0010036.sd004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title/><sec id="sb1a1"><title>Background</title><p>Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which is used to treat patients with HIV, can have nasty side effects and is expensive. As a result, for the last five years scientists have been trying to determine if it is possible to give patients breaks from taking antiretroviral drugs, without patients' health suffering. It is likely that such a treatment strategy (called &#x0201c;supervised treatment interruption,&#x0201d; or STI) will not work in patients who have been infected with HIV for a long time. However, until now, the jury was out about whether STI could be of benefit to patients who had only recently been infected with HIV. Some research suggested that if newly infected patients had short &#x0201c;holidays&#x0201d; from taking HAART, it might help to boost their immune system&#x02014;which in turn might help to keep HIV at bay.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a2"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers studied 14 patients who had recently been infected with HIV. Patients were treated until their viral load was below the limit of detection by using a very sensitive method. As they were then watched after treatment interruption, most of them were able to maintain a low, though detectable, viral load for some time. The researchers then stopped the treatment and carefully watched the patients over a period of up to five years. If the number of viruses in the patients' blood rose too high, the researchers gave the patients HAART again until the number of viruses fell again. In about half the patients, treatment needed to be restarted within a year because the viruses had started becoming more numerous in the blood. The doctors had hoped that it would take much longer for the number of viruses to reach this level. In other words, giving patients &#x0201c;drug holidays&#x0201d; did not help to keep the virus at bay for long periods of time.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a3"><title>What Are the Limitations of the Study?</title><p>It is relatively rare for doctors to be able to diagnose HIV shortly after an individual becomes infected with the virus. Many people have HIV for a long time before they see a doctor. Therefore, even if the STI strategy had worked, it would only have been relevant to a few patients. In addition, the study was small and preliminary, so we have to be careful about reading too much into the results. A limitation in the study is that it did not address whether there might be a long-term clinical benefit despite a gradual increase in viral load.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a4"><title>What Does This Study Mean for Patients?</title><p>It is important to remember that this was an experimental trial&#x02014;patients with HIV should not stop taking antiretroviral drugs unless their doctor specifically tells them to do so. Although it looks as though STI may not work in the way everyone had hoped, these results may help scientists develop an HIV vaccine that is designed to keep the disease at bay. Whether early treatment of acute infection has an overall benefit in terms of time-to-development of AIDS or need for long-term treatment after drug discontinuation will need to be answered in larger clinical trials designed to answer these important questions.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a5"><title>Resources on the Web.</title><p>AIDSinfo: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/</ext-link></p><p>AIDSmap: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.aidsmap.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.aidsmap.com/</ext-link></p><p>Medline Plus AIDS Information: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/aids.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/aids.html</ext-link></p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all study participants for their invaluable help and Roche Molecular Systems for generous support in providing HIV-1 Amplicor viral load testing kits.

Virologic failure was defined as having a viral load of greater than 5,000 copies RNA/ml plasma for 3 wk or greater than 50,000 copies once. Patients still achieving viral control at the last visit and individuals restarting therapy without meeting criteria or lost in follow-up are censored at the last evaluable time point. The horizontal axis represents the time off therapy since the beginning of the treatment interruption, the vertical axis corresponds to the number of patients maintaining control of viremia.

Slopes of CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts during the first year of the longest treatment interruption are shown for patients who experienced a cessation of therapy of at least 12 mo (all except AC13, AC25, and AC45), compared to the natural decline of CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts in untreated patients of the MACS cohort with early chronic HIV-1 infection (CD4&#x0002b; counts of &#x0003e;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>).
