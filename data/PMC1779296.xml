In this study, we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, KZ52, to protect against Ebola virus in rhesus macaques. This antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection. Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge. A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment. Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection. We show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape. It appears that Ebola virus has a mechanism of infection propagation in vivo in macaques that is uniquely insensitive even to high concentrations of neutralizing antibody.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Ebola virus is one of the most feared of human pathogens with a mortality that can approach 90&#x00025; and an extremely rapid disease course that can lead to death within days of infection. Antibodies able to inhibit viral infection in culture, neutralizing antibodies, can typically prevent viral infection in animals and humans when present prior to infection, at sufficient concentration. Such neutralizing antibodies may be provided through passive administration or induced by vaccination. We have previously shown that a human neutralizing antibody can protect guinea pigs against Ebola virus. However, here we show that this antibody does not protect monkeys against Ebola virus and surprisingly appears to have very little impact upon the rapid course of infection, despite being present at very high levels in the blood of the monkeys. We conclude that administering antibody prior to or immediately following exposure to Ebola virus, for example, after an accident in a research setting or a bioterrorist attack, is unlikely to be effective in preventing disease. Recent successes in protecting monkeys against Ebola virus through vaccination may be independent of antibody, or, more likely, critically dependent on the cooperation of antibody and cellular immunity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Oswald WB, Geisbert TW, Davis KJ, Geisbert JB, Sullivan NJ, et al.

Relatively low viral levels were observed in most of the organs of CH46, and none in the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands. In addition, large immunoreactive monocytes were found in the blood of monkeys CH56, CH57, and CH83, but not in CH46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030009-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Typically, smaller immunoreactive monocytes are seen with ZEBOV infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The presence of large immunoreactive monocytes may simply reflect uptake of antibody-coated virions via Fc receptors and subsequent viral clearance. However, it is interesting to note that previous studies have implicated mononuclear phagocytes as vehicles for transport of filovirus particles to specific organs such as liver and spleen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

Interestingly, monkey CH46, who fared somewhat better than the others and lacked virus in the liver and spleen, did not show the presence of large immunoreactive monocytes. This is suggestive of lowered Fc receptor-mediated uptake of virus or reduced activity of the mononuclear phagocytic system.</p><table-wrap id="ppat-0030009-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Posthumous Viral Loads in Specific Organs of Rhesus Macaques</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.0030009.t002"/></table-wrap><fig id="ppat-0030009-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A Large Immunoreactive Monocyte Is Observed in a Blood Vessel in the Kidney of Monkey CH57 Postmortem</title><p>Similar cells were observed in analysis of monkeys CH83 and CH56.

The antibody appeared to have very little effect on the course of virus replication or disease in three of four treated animals. Neutralization escape does not appear to explain the lack of protection observed by the antibody. In one animal, a more limited infection was observed, but this macaque did also eventually succumb to the effects of viral disease.</p><p>The challenge dose of 1,000 pfu used corresponds to the amount of EBOV contained in a relatively small quantity of fluid (on the order of 1 &#x003bc;l) from an infected individual given the high titers of virus typically found in such individuals (on the order of 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/ml of blood, for example). Therefore, the challenge dose was not unreasonable in terms of a natural exposure to virus.</p><p>The negative results with passive antibody contrast strongly with recent successes in preventing EBOV infection in macaques through vaccination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Does this mean that neutralizing antibody is unimportant in vaccine protection? The answer to this question must await further studies. However, a plausible hypothesis to explain all the data would still allow for an important contribution of antibody to vaccine protection. This hypothesis would argue that passive antibody is unable to completely block all EBOV entry to cells, and once a few cells are infected, virus replication is so explosive that it cannot be contained by a de novo generated cellular immune response. Vaccination, on the other hand, will provide CD8&#x0002b; memory T cells that can be rapidly recruited to become effector cells and limit infection. Certainly, although mAb KZ52 was able to provide protection from disease following ZEBOV challenge in the guinea pig model, immunity was not sterilizing and some viral replication was noted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Since 1 pfu of EBOV is a lethal dose for primates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, a failure of passive antibody to achieve sterilizing immunity may be critical. Immunohistochemistry, as discussed above, gives some intriguing hints that uptake of antibody-coated virions by monocytes may possibly have a role to play in the course of infection following antibody treatment. We note, however, that previous in vitro studies using isolated human monocytes/macrophages did not find evidence of infectivity-enhancing antibodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. More detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations will be required before any firm conclusions can be drawn. We also note that our experiments were carried out with a single neutralizing monoclonal antibody. It is possible that a more favorable outcome may have been apparent for a combination of neutralizing antibodies or even a combination of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. However, these possibilities should be weighed against the very high concentrations of neutralizing monoclonal antibody used in the experiments and the efficacy of the antibody in the guinea pig model.</p><p>In summary, the inability of high concentrations of neutralizing antibody to even slow viral replication in infected macaques is remarkable and implies a mechanism of infection propagation that is virtually insensitive to antibody. Overall, the results suggest that monoclonal antibody prophylaxis or post-exposure prophylaxis alone are unlikely to be effective strategies in protecting against EBOV, for example, following a needle-stick accident in a research setting or a bioterrorist attack.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Passive transfer experiment.</title><p>50 mg/kg of KZ52 IgG1 human antibody &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; was given intravenously to rhesus macaques (weight, 3.9&#x02013;4.4 kg) 1 d before challenge (day 0) with 1,000 pfu intramuscularly of the 1995 ZEBOV (Kikwit) isolate and again 4 d later (day &#x0002b;4).
