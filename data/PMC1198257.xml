CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells have an important role in antiviral immune responses and animal studies suggest a role for CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. We have previously shown that the presence of IL-4 during stimulation increases the frequency of IL-5-positive cells and CD30 surface staining in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from healthy, normal subjects. In this study, we investigated whether excess IL-4 during repeated TCR/CD3 stimulation of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from atopic asthmatic subjects alters the balance of type 1/type 2 cytokine production in favour of the latter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Peripheral blood CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from mild atopic asthmatic subjects were stimulated <italic>in vitro </italic>with anti-CD3 and IL-2 &#x000b1; excess IL-4 and the expression of activation and adhesion molecules and type 1 and type 2 cytokine production were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Surface expression of very late antigen-4 [VLA-4] and LFA-1 was decreased and the production of the type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 was augmented by the presence of IL-4 during stimulation of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from mild atopic asthmatics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data suggest that during a respiratory virus infection activated CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from asthmatic subjects may produce excess type 2 cytokines and may contribute to asthma exacerbation by augmenting allergic inflammation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthmatic airways are characterised by high levels of IL-4 due to excess Th2 responses to common aeroallergens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Respiratory viruses are associated with 80 to 85% of asthma exacerbations in children and with 60% in adults and rhinovirus (RV) is common in all age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We have found that atopic asthmatic subjects suffer from more severe and longer lasting lower respiratory tract symptoms when infected with RV than do normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but the mechanisms are not known. We proposed that one mechanism could be that immune responses to virus infection are type 1 deficient/type 2 augmented if they take place in a milieu rich in the type 2 cytokine IL-4 as occurs in atopic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Optimal CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell responses to respiratory viruses are predominantly type 1 and over exuberant type 2 responses are detrimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Animal studies suggest that immune responses to virus infections are characterized by an increase in the frequency of type 2 cytokine-producing T cells if they take place in an allergic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Data from human studies also show that an excessive type 2/deficient type 1 cytokine response to RSV-infection in the respiratory tract is associated with a more severe clinical course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We have published data showing that human CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from both normal and asthmatic subjects have the capacity to produce type 2 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have recently shown that stimulation of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from normal, healthy subjects in an IL-4 rich milieu significantly increased the number of IL-5-positive CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Due to excess Th2 immune response to allergens, CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from atopic asthmatic subjects are continuous exposed to IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Here we investigated whether exogenous IL-4 present during TCR/CD3 stimulation modulates cell growth, surface phenotype (activation markers and adhesion molecules) and type 1 (IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3;) and type 2 (IL-4, -5, -13) cytokine production in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from atopic asthmatic subjects. We found that the presence of exogenous IL-4 during the activation of mild atopic asthmatic CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells enhanced cell growth and increased IL-5 and IL-13 production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Peripheral blood (40 to 50 mL) was obtained from 10 patients fulfilling clinical diagnostic criteria for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and showing hyperreactivity to inhaled methacholine (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

It has previously been reported that IL-4 may act as a growth factor for human CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell clones and that there is a synergy between IL-2 and IL-4 during CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This suggests that stimulation of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in an environment rich in IL-4 may result in the expansion of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells when exogenous IL-2 is present.</p><p>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells exposed to repeated stimulation in the presence of exogenous IL-4 decreased their expression of the &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>integrin (VLA-4, CD49d/CD29) and &#x003b1;<sub>L</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18). VLA-4 is a surface marker associated with the capacity of T cells to migrate towards sites of antigen stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and it has been previously reported that CD49d membrane expression on Th1 and Th2 clones is markedly reduced by activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The reduction in the levels of adhesion molecules as a result of activation of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells may play a role in the retention of activated cells at sites of antigenic stimulation. Recently, in an animal model it was reported that type 2 or type 0 CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells had decreased surface VLA-4 density and deficient activation-induced LFA-1/ICAM-1-dependent homotypic adhesion <italic>in vitro </italic>and consequently reduced antiviral activity <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The presence of exogenous IL-4 during stimulation of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells also tended to increase the frequencies of CD30-positive cells. The expression of CD30, a member of the TNF receptor family, by T cells has been previously reported to be primarily regulated by IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and preferentially expressed by type 2 and type 0 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These data collectively suggest that the presence of IL-4 in the microenvironment induces a phenotype of cells similar to tissue-resident cells and induces patterns of expression of adhesion molecules associated with adoption of type 2 function. These data suggest our <italic>in vitro </italic>observations on induction of type 2 functions more likely to truly reflect events occurring in the lungs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We have found that peripheral blood CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from atopic asthmatic individuals, when stimulated in the presence of exogenous IL-4, released higher levels of IL-5 and IL-13 as compared with CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells stimulated in the absence of IL-4. It has previously been reported that exogenous IL-4 increased production of IL-4 and IL-5 in stimulated neonatal CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, it is now known that neonatal T cells are skewed towards a type 2 phenotype and may, therefore, not be representative of adult human CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We have recently reported induction of type 2 activities in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from healthy adult subjects during TCR stimulation by the presence of exogenous IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, we observed only a tendency to increased IL-5-production and no increased IL-13-production in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from normal subjects [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and unpublished data]. In the present study we extend these findings to confirm that induction by IL-4 of type 2 activities also occurs in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from asthmatic subjects and demonstrate the deviation in phenotype towards type 2 is more extensive with increases in IL-5 and IL-13 production.</p><p>Respiratory virus infections are frequently associated with asthma exacerbations and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells are important in anti-viral immune responses. Given the above data in our <italic>in vitro </italic>model, we suggest that stimulation of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells during viral infections in an environment enriched in IL-4 as occurs in asthma is likely to favour the induction of type 2 cytokine synthesis by CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. Production of type 2 cytokines by CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells during immune responses to viral infections in asthma has the potential to augment allergic inflammation by a number of different mechanisms including each of the type 2 cytokines measured in this study. This hypothesis is lent credence by our recent observations that virus infection and allergen exposure are synergistic risk factors for acute exacerbations of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>By antagonising the production of IFN-&#x003b3;, type 2 cytokines may also have effects on the capacity of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells to clear virus. In our culture conditions, even though exogenous IL-4 did not significantly decrease the levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, the levels remained stable and the ratio of IL-4/IFN-&#x003b3; was increased (data not shown). It is quite possible that during respiratory viral infections in asthmatic relative to normal subjects <italic>in vivo</italic>, where the stimulation conditions are different, IFN-&#x003b3; production is depressed as a result of these mechanisms. This hypothesis is supported by the observation in mice that elevation of IL-4 levels concurrent with viral infections suppresses or delays activation of virus-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells and leads to delayed viral clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We have previously reported a significant increase in submucosal CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>lymphocytes and in epithelial eosinophils in both normal and asthmatic subjects with experimental rhinovirus infections, and in asthmatic subjects eosinophil numbers remained elevated during convalescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These data suggest that modulation by IL-4 of CD8<sup>+ </sup>virus-specific immune responses towards a type 2 phenotype may occur in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that this may be an important mechanism in virus-induced exacerbations of asthma acting both by augmenting allergic inflammation and by diminishing viral clearance. A recent rhinovirus experimental infection study has supported this hypothesis by observing impaired virus clearance and increased symptoms in subjects with increased IL-5/IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA ratios in induced sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate induction of type 2 cytokine production and a tissue-resident phenotype by exogenous IL-4 in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells from atopic asthmatic subjects. Given the excess IL-4 observed in asthma we believe that these mechanisms may play an important role in impairing virus clearance and augmenting allergic inflammation in virus-induced asthma. We are currently testing this possibility <italic>in vivo </italic>in human experimental virus infection models.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LAS participated in the design of the study, performed the studies and drafted the manuscript.
