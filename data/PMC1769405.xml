Smooth muscle cells are considered to play a role in the type 2 immune response&#x02013;driven expulsion of gastrointestinal nematodes. Previous studies have shown in vitro that signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 signaling in response to parasitic nematode infection significantly increases smooth muscle cell contractility. Inhibition of the IL-4R&#x003b1; pathway inhibits this response. How this response manifests itself in vivo is unknown. In this study, smooth muscle cell IL-4R&#x003b1;&#x02013;deficient mice (SM-MHC<sup>Cre</sup>IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/lox</sup>) were generated and characterized to uncover any role for IL-4/IL-13 in this non&#x02013;immune cell type in response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</named-content> infection. IL-4R&#x003b1; was absent from &#x003b1;-actin&#x02013;positive smooth muscle cells, while other cell types showed normal IL-4R&#x003b1; expression, thus demonstrating efficient cell-type&#x02013;specific deletion of the IL-4R&#x003b1; gene. <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. brasiliensis</named-content>&#x02013;infected SM-MHC<sup>Cre</sup>IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/lox</sup> mice showed delayed ability to resolve infection with significantly prolonged fecal egg recovery and delayed worm expulsion. The delayed expulsion was related to a delayed intestinal goblet cell hyperplasia, reduced T helper 2 cytokine production in the mesenteric lymph node, and reduced M3 muscarinic receptor expression during infection. Together, these results demonstrate that in vivo IL-4R&#x003b1;&#x02013;responsive smooth muscle cells are beneficial for <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. brasiliensis</named-content> expulsion by coordinating T helper 2 cytokine responses, goblet hyperplasia, and acetylcholine responsiveness, which drive smooth muscle cell contractions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Intestinal parasitic worm infections are a major public health concern, with more than 1 billion people infected worldwide. Symptoms associated with these infections are similar to that of other intestinal illnesses, including irritable bowel syndrome. It is likely that the immune response required to expel the worm can also, when activated inappropriately, cause the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. This makes understanding parasitic worm infections important in their own right and also as a model for other intestinal illnesses. In previous studies, we demonstrated the crucial importance of interleukin 4 receptor &#x003b1; (IL-4R&#x003b1;) responsiveness for worm expulsion in global IL-4R&#x003b1;&#x02013;deficient mice. In this study, we specifically addressed the role of IL-4R&#x003b1; responsiveness in a novel smooth muscle cell&#x02013;specific IL-4R&#x003b1;&#x02013;deficient mouse model. These mice showed decreased ability to control the worm infection, with delayed expulsion and reduced protective immune responses. These data provide compelling evidence for smooth muscle cell IL-4R&#x003b1; being an important coordinator of both the immune and physiological responses to intestinal worm infections. A proposed model is suggested with IL-4R&#x003b1; responsiveness on smooth muscle cells coordinating T helper 2 cytokine responses, goblet hyperplasia, and acetylcholine-driven smooth muscle contractions for optimal worm expulsion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Horsnell WGC, Cutler AJ, Hoving CJ, Mearns H, Myburgh E, et al.

Mutant mouse strains were identified by PCR genotyping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030001-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), and cell specificity of disrupted IL-4R&#x003b1; expression was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS).</p><p>IL-4R&#x003b1; expression was analyzed on &#x003b1;-actin&#x02013;positive cells derived from aortic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030001-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).

Pathogen-induced mucus production is strongly influenced by the host immune response.

Previous studies have established the importance of this epithelial response, the most significant cells for effective expulsion being the mucus-producing goblet cells. This body of work combined with the data we present suggests that smooth muscle cells may represent an intermediate zone of signal transduction between the epithelium and MLNs. Disruption of the ability of the smooth muscle cells to respond to IL-4R&#x003b1; ultimately results in a delayed mucosal response and depressed MLN cytokine production.</p><p>Prolonged <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. brasiliensis</named-content> infection, due to a deficiency in smooth muscle cell expression of IL-4R&#x003b1;, may therefore be a result of the host's inability to mount an effective mucus response. Delayed mucus responses to <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. brasiliensis</named-content> infection are associated with an impaired T<sub>H</sub>2 response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030001-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The delayed expulsion we report here is then explained by the reduced MLN CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>H</sub>2 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030001-g003">Figure 3</xref>), delaying mucus production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030001-g006">Figure 6</xref>) through inhibition of smooth muscle responsiveness to neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030001-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and cytokines. The depressed T<sub>H</sub>2 response we suggest to be a result of smooth muscle cells being unable to react effectively to the key smooth muscle contraction amplifying cytokine IL-13 and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030001-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; sufficiently to stimulate rapid cytokine production in the MLNs. Parasite clearance would then be more reliant on local effector lymphoid tissue responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030001-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The resulting recovery in response to infection and its eventual clearance in the SM-MHC<sup>Cre</sup>IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/lox</sup> mouse may then be explained by local responses in the intestine providing a sufficient, albeit delayed and reduced compensatory response which induces the eventual disease-resolving response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030001-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated in vivo a significant role for smooth muscle cell IL-4R&#x003b1; in the optimal resolution of a gastrointestinal nematode infection. Deletion of smooth muscle IL-4R&#x003b1; significantly disrupts the host ability to resolve infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. brasiliensis</named-content>. We demonstrate severe disruption of both known and proposed mediators of expulsion. Depressed M3 receptor expression, delayed goblet cell hyperplasia, disruption of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLNs, and intestinal cytokine production provide compelling evidence for an important role in the induction of both physiological effector mechanisms and immunological mediators of expulsion. Together, these data are suggestive of smooth muscle IL-4R&#x003b1; being an important inducer of T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine signaling from the lymph node and tissue and goblet cell hyperplasia and having a striking effect on the key smooth muscle contraction&#x02013;inducing M3 muscarinic receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030001-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation and genotyping of conditional IL-4R&#x003b1;&#x02013;deficient mice.</title><p>SM-MHC<sup>Cre</sup> mice were a kind gift from Gary K.
