He was a nonsmoker and denied a history of any other bladder carcinogen exposure except for occasional pesticide application during agricultural work. Intravenous urogram imaging showed a mass occupying half of the bladder capacity. Cystoscopy revealed a mass over the left dome of the bladder. Cystoscopic biopsy revealed a grade 3 invasive transitional cell carcinoma with marked necrosis. From 1987 until hospital admission in 2001, the patient had worked in a company that produced the 4,4&#x02032;-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA) curing agent. He did not wear any personal protective equipment during work. Ambient air MBOCA levels in the purification process area (0.23&#x02013;0.41 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) exceeded the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#x02019;s permissible exposure level. Urinary MBOCA levels (267.9&#x02013;15701.1 &#x003bc;g/g creatinine) far exceeded the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#x02019;s reference value of 100 &#x003bc;g/L. This patient worked in the purification process with occupational exposure to MBOCA for 14 years. According to the environmental and biologic monitoring data and latency period, and excluding other potential bladder carcinogen exposure, this worker was diagnosed as having occupational bladder cancer due to high exposure to MBOCA through inhalation or dermal absorption in the purification area. This case finding supports that MBOCA is a potential human carcinogen. Safe use of skin-protective equipment and respirators is required to prevent workers from MBOCA exposure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>MBOCA</kwd><kwd>transitional cell carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Incidence and mortality rates of bladder cancer vary about 10-fold worldwide.

In Taiwan, the incidence and mortality rates of bladder cancer (per 100,000) in 2000 were 8.93 and 3.00 for males and 3.87 and 1.36 for females, respectively &#x0005b;Taiwan Department of Health (DOH) 2004&#x0005d;. Transitional cell carcinomas account for about 95% of bladder neoplasms. The remaining 5% consist of squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0113-000771">Engel et al. 2002</xref>). Cigarette smoking and occupational exposures are well-documented risk factors for bladder cancer. Other known or suspected risk factors for bladder cancer include race, sex, age, lifestyle, chlorination by-products and arsenic in drinking water, ionizing radiation, bladder infection, high consumption of phenacetin-containing analgesics, and hair dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0113-000771">Engel et al. 2002</xref>). Several genetic susceptibility factors have been found to be related to bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0113-000771">Engel et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Bladder cancer is associated with a number of occupational exposures. The first such association was observed in 1895 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp0113-000771">Rehn 1895</xref>), and subsequent research among dyestuff workers identified the aromatic amines benzidine and 2-naphthylamine as bladder carcinogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0113-000771">Case et al. 1954</xref>). Several other aromatic amines and related compounds have also been identified as suspected human bladder carcinogens, including 1-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl, 4-chloro-<italic>o</italic>-toluidine, <italic>o</italic>-toluidine, and 4,4&#x02032;-methylenedianiline &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0113-000771">Engel et al. 2002</xref>; International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 1987&#x0005d;.

In a U.S. retrospective bladder cancer incidence study, 385 of 532 workers ever exposed to MBOCA from 1968 to 1979 and 20 workers who were first employed in 1980 and 1981 participated in a urine screening test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp0113-000771">Ward et al. 1990</xref>). Workers were exposed to MBOCA for a median employment period of 3.2 months (between 1968 and 1981). Cystoscopy revealed a papillary cell tumor in one worker, and low-grade papillary transitional cell tumors of the urinary bladder were diagnosed in 2 of the remaining 200 workers examined by cystoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp0113-000771">Ward et al. 1990</xref>). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has determined that MBOCA may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0113-000771">ATSDR 1994</xref>). IARC has determined that MBOCA is probably carcinogenic to humans (category 2A; IARC 1993). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has determined that MBOCA is a probable human carcinogen (category 2A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0113-000771">ATSDR 1994</xref>). In the <italic>Report on Carcinogens, Eleventh Edition</italic> &#x0005b;National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2005&#x0005d;, the NTP reported that MBOCA may reasonably be anticipated to be a human carcinogen.

He was a nonsmoker and denied taking any medication. He did not use hair dye or reside in an area with endemic blackfoot disease (arsenic intoxication). Social alcohol drinking was noted.</p><p>Microscopic hematuria was noted in the periodic health examinations for about 2 years, but the patient ignored it. Two months before admission, he developed nocturia about five times per night. Paroxysmal painless hematuria was also noted. Gross hematuria accompanied by lower abdominal distress occurred 2 weeks before admission. His body weight had decreased from 75 kg to 72 kg over the previous 3 months. He visited the hospital, and an intravenous urogram (IVU) showed a mass occupying half of the bladder capacity. Cystoscopy revealed a mass over the left dome area of the bladder. Cystoscopic biopsy specimens revealed a grade 3/3 invasive transitional cell carcinoma with marked necrosis. Radical cystectomy with ileal conduit combined with radiotherapy was performed because the bladder tissue showed lymphovascular permeation with lymph node metastasis. The worker is still on medical leave because of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="background"><title>Occupational history.</title><p>The manufacturing of MBOCA includes the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and packing processes. Briefly, <italic>o</italic>-chloroaniline is reacted with sulfuric acid and formaldehyde under the catalyst of stannous chloride for 3&#x02013;4 hr. The MBOCA products are then neutralized with an alkali, sodium hydroxide, at a high temperature. After washing and purification, the solid MBOCA is cut into pellets. Although most of the processes are done in closed systems and are automatic, leakage of products from pipes and tanks has been reported. The work schedule in the factory where our patient worked has three 8-hr shifts, and three or four workers in each shift are assigned to each manufacturing line.</p><p>The patient was a farmer until he began working at this factory. He worked in the purification area of this MBOCA-producing company for 14 years (1987&#x02013;2001), and he did not wear any personal protective equipment during work. He denied working for any chemical company other than his present company. He occasionally applied pesticides during agricultural work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Environmental monitoring data.</title><p>An area sampling program to monitor MBOCA levels in the work environment of this MBOCA manufacturing factory was initiated by the Taiwan Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), Council of Labor Affairs (IOSH 2003a). The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#x02019;s (OSHA) Analytic Method 24 was adopted in this study (OSHA 1981). Briefly, an impinger filled with 0.1N HCl was used for sampling. The sampling rate was 1 L/min. The sampling time was &#x0003e; 6 hr or &#x0003e; 100 L air. The solution was then analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) detector. The detection limit was 0.056 &#x003bc;g/mL. A quality assurance and quality control program was implemented during the sampling and analysis procedures. All quality tests were shown to be adequate (IOSH 2003a).</p><p>Two consecutive days&#x02019; air samples were collected in the MBOCA-manufacturing factory, in the areas where the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and cutting/packing processes took place. The concentration of MBOCA was highest in the purification area (0.23&#x02013;0.41 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2), followed by the washing area (&#x0003c; 0.02&#x02013;0.08 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7) and the neutralization area (&#x0003c; 0.05&#x02013;0.06 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2) (IOSH 2003a).

After cleaning with the Extrelut NT3 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and evaporating with methanol, the concentrated urine was analyzed by HPLC with a 254 nm UV detector. The limit of detection was 9.54 &#x003bc;g/L.</p><p>Urine from 10 workers in this MBOCA-manufacturing company was analyzed.

It is also widely used, primarily in industries producing castable polyurethane elastomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0113-000771">ATSDR 1994</xref>). Therefore, the health impact of MBOCA is still of concern in occupational settings in many countries. In this article we report the first known case of MBOCA-related occupational bladder cancer in Taiwan, which led to the establishment of recommended exposure levels of MBOCA in the workplace. This case report supports the conclusion that MBOCA is a potential human carcinogen.</p><p>Environmental monitoring of MBOCA levels in ambient air performed in the present study showed that the concentration was high in the purification process area (0.23&#x02013;0.41 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) and exceeded the OSHA permissible exposure level (0.22 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) and NIOSH&#x02019;s recommended exposure level of MBOCA (3 mg/m<sup>3</sup> as a 10-hr time-weighted average) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp0113-000771">Ward et al. 1990</xref>).

However, in Australia, monitoring of workers at seven facilities that used MBOCA in the manufacture of polyurethane polymers showed that the average MBOCA levels in the urine of the workers dropped from 29,600 to 10,400 &#x003bc;g/L within 8&#x02013;9 months after the implementation of an exposure prevention program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ehp0113-000771">Wan et al. 1989</xref>).</p><p>The bladder cancer patient reported here worked in the purification process with high exposure to MBOCA for 14 years.

Workplace monitoring by air sampling has been reported to be useless because contamination may occur in the absence of observable air levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0113-000771">Clapp et al. 1991</xref>). Biological monitoring of urine MBOCA concentration is a useful method to assess percutaneous MBOCA absorption. Because MBOCA is a potential human carcinogen, it is important to reduce exposure primarily through engineering ventilation controls. However, safe use of skin protective equipment and respirators is required to prevent MBOCA exposure. In addition, appropriate clearance of spills, work training, air monitoring, and periodic health examinations are recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0113-000771">ATSDR 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0113-000771">Clapp et al. 1991</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ehp0113-000771"><citation citation-type="other"><collab>ATSDR</collab>1994.
