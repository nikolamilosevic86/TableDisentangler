We postulated that reductions in mitochondrial activity might predispose these individuals to increased IMCL accumulation, which in turn would lead to defects in insulin signaling and insulin action in skeletal muscle. In order to further characterize the regulation of mitochondrial activity in these individuals, we assessed insulin-stimulated rates of ATP synthesis in a similar group of young, lean, IR offspring as well as in a group of age&#x02013;BMI&#x02013;activity-matched control group participants using <sup>31</sup>P MRS. We found that insulin was a potent stimulator of muscle ATP synthesis in that it increased this flux by 90&#x00025; over basal rates in the control participants. In contrast, insulin-stimulated rates of ATP synthase flux were severely blunted in the IR offspring where a similar increase in plasma insulin concentrations increased this flux by only 5&#x00025; over basal rates. These data demonstrate that the defects in basal rates of mitochondrial phosphorylation activity, previously found in the IR offspring, are even more pronounced under insulin-stimulated conditions and are consistent with a recent in vitro study that found reduced insulin-stimulated rates of oxidative phosphorylation activity in isolated mitochondria obtained from muscle biopsy samples of participants with type 2 diabetes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together these data suggest that the observed defect in insulin-stimulated rates of ATP synthesis is a very early defect in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Insulin also stimulates intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> transport into skeletal muscle, which accounts for much of its hypophosphatemic effects in vivo. Previous in vitro studies by Polgreen et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d; have demonstrated that insulin stimulates Na-dependent intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> influx in a mouse myoblast cell line in a relatively rapid manner that is independent of protein synthesis. These authors speculated that insulin regulates intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> transport into skeletal muscle by recruitment of intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> transporters to the cell surface in a fashion similar to insulin regulation of glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle. Using <sup>31</sup>P MRS to assess intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> content before and during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, we found a marked reduction of insulin-stimulated intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> transport into skeletal muscle of the IR offspring. The parallel reductions in insulin-stimulated rates of muscle glucose metabolism, which can mostly be attributed to reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;, and reduced insulin-stimulated phosphate transport activity suggests that a common insulin-signaling defect may be responsible for both of these abnormalities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b28">28</xref>&#x0005d;. We also observed a strong correlation between insulin-stimulated increases in intramyocellular phosphate concentrations and insulin-stimulated increases in rates of ATP synthesis in control participants and IR offspring. Inorganic phosphate is the substrate for the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate to ATP during oxidative phosphorylation, and it is also a putative cytosolic signaling molecule in the regulation of this process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

Taken together these data suggest that insulin regulation of phosphate transport may be an important mechanism by which insulin regulates ATP synthesis in human skeletal muscle. If this is true, then it is possible that the observed reductions in insulin-stimulated rates of muscle ATP synthesis, which were observed in the IR offspring, may be secondary to the increased IMCL content that results in impaired insulin signaling and decreased insulin-stimulated phosphate transport &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b09">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020233-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

Therefore it appears unlikely that reductions in insulin-stimulated muscle capillary recruitment have a major role in explaining the observed reductions in insulin-stimulated ATP synthesis and intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> transport in the IR offspring.</p><p>In summary, these data provide further evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of IR offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes. These individuals also manifest severe defects in insulin-stimulated phosphate transport in skeletal muscle, which may contribute to their observed defects in insulin-stimulated rates of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Given the potentially important role that intracellular phosphate might have on regulating mitochondrial ATP production, we propose that regulation of intramyocellular P<sub>i</sub> transport into the muscle cell by insulin may be an important mechanism by which insulin regulates mitochondrial ATP synthesis in skeletal muscle.</p><boxed-text id="pmed-0020233-box1" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background</title><p>Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases. We know quite a bit about the risk factors that predispose people to diabetes (such as being overweight), but we do not understand well how the disease starts (usually in adults but increasingly in teenagers and even children).</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Children whose parents are diabetic have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes themselves. Some of them have the first signs of the disease (a condition called insulin resistance, which is a strong predictor for subsequent development of diabetes) while they are still young and lean. The group of Gerald Shulman (who is the senior author of this study) has studied such individuals to understand the causes and effects of their insulin resistance. Having previously found some abnormalities in the mitochondria (the parts of cells involved in generating energy), they studied mitochondrial function in more detail here.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They compared seven young lean insulin-resistant adults with a family history of diabetes with seven lean young adults without diabetic family members and with normal insulin sensitivity. Specifically, they looked at energy generated in the muscles in response to insulin stimulation. They found that while insulin increases energy production in the muscles of the control individuals by approximately 90&#x00025;, it had very little effect in the insulin-resistant individuals. They also studied the amount of inorganic phosphate (an essential trace element) in muscle cells of both groups, and how it was affected by insulin. They found that in control individuals, insulin results in an increase of phosphate transport into the muscle cells and that this is also much reduced in insulin-resistant individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Does This Mean?</title><p>Intracellular phosphate is a key regulator of energy generation, and this study provides more support for the notion that insulin resistance compromises proper functioning of energy generation in the mitochondria of muscle cells. This and similar studies should eventually result in a better understanding of the early events in diabetes. The hope is that this will then allow the development of therapies that might prevent the disease or treat its symptoms more effectively.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Where Can I Find More Information Online?</title><p>The following Web sites contain information on diabetes and insulin resistance.</p><p>US National Diabetes Clearinghouse (English and Spanish):</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/insulinresistance/" ext-link-type="uri">http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/insulinresistance/</ext-link></p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/spanish/indexsp.asp" ext-link-type="uri">http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/spanish/indexsp.asp</ext-link></p><p>Stanford University Web site on syndrome X, diabetes, and insulin resistance:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://syndromex.stanford.edu/" ext-link-type="uri">http://syndromex.stanford.edu/</ext-link></p><p>Diabetes UK:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.diabetes.org.uk/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.diabetes.org.uk/</ext-link></p><p>American Diabetes Association (English and Spanish):</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.diabetes.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.diabetes.org/</ext-link></p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.diabetes.org/espanol/default.jsp" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.diabetes.org/espanol/default.jsp</ext-link></p><p>Information on Dr. Shulman's research:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/shulman.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/shulman.html</ext-link></p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Yanna Kosover, Mikhail Smolgovsky, Amy Dennean, Pritpal Rhandawa, M.D., and the staff of the Yale University&#x02013;New Haven Hospital General Clinical Research Center for expert technical assistance with the studies and the volunteers for participating in this study.
