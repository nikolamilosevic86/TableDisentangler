The purpose of the study was to determine the dose of cyclosporin A (CsA), in combination with doxorubicin (DOX) and ifosfamide (IFX), needed to achieve steady-state whole-blood levels of 2000 ng ml-1 and the associated toxicity of this combination. Treatment consisted of CsA 5 mg kg-1 as a 2 h loading infusion, followed by a CsA 3 day continuous infusion (c.i.) (days 1-3) at doses that were escalated from 10 to 18 mg kg-1 day-1. Chemotherapy consisted of DOX 55 mg m-2 by i.v. 24 h c.i. (day 2) and IFX 2 g m-2 i.v. over 1 h on days 1 and 3. Treatments were repeated every 4 weeks. Eighteen patients with previously treated resistant solid tumours received 39 cycles. Mean steady-state CsA levels &#x0003e; or = 2000 ng ml-1 were reached at 5 mg kg-1 loading dose followed by a 3 day c.i. of 16 mg kg-1 day-1 or greater. Haematological toxicity was greater than expected for the same chemotherapy alone. One patient died of intracranial haemorrhage due to severe thrombopenia. Other observed toxicities were: asymptomatic hyperbilirubinaemia (46% cycles), mild nephrotoxicity (20% cycles), hypomagnesaemia (72% cycles), mild increase in body weight (100% cycles), hypertension (15% cycles) and headache (15% cycles). Overall the toxicity was acceptable and manageable. No alterations in absolute lymphocyte number, the lymphocyte subsets studied (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19) or CD4/CD8 ratio were observed in patients receiving more than one treatment cycle, although there were significant and non-uniform variations in the values of the different lymphocyte subsets studied when pre- and post-treatment values were compared. There was also a significant increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio. Tumour regressions were observed in two patients (epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix and Ewing's sarcoma). The CsA dose recommended for phase II trials is a 5 mg kg-1 loading dose followed by a 3-day c.i. of 16 mg kg-1 day-1 simultaneously with DOX and IFX at the doses administered in this study.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00045-0234.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1294" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00045-0235.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1295" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00045-0236.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1296" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00045-0237.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1297" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00045-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1298" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00045-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1299" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
