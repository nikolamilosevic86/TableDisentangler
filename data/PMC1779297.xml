Even when T cells specifically recognized the antigen presented by DCs, the infection of T cells was principally mediated by virions remaining at the surface of the DCs. Interestingly, in this context of antigen-specific recognition, which increases the trafficking toward the immunological synapse of DC internal vesicles, where HIV-1 virions seem to hide, a few internal virions could infect T cells.

In the de novo pathway, DCs are actively infected with HIV, leading to the budding and spread of new virions to neighboring CD4 T cells. In the prevailing model of the <italic>trans</italic> pathway, intact HIV-1 virions are captured by alternative HIV-1 receptors, which bind virions without triggering fusion, and internalized into clustered compartments resembling late endosome/multivesicular bodies (MVBs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

HIV-1 could divert the intracellular trafficking of immunological synapse components to avoid degradation and thus survive until later transmitted to T cells. Alternatively, external virions could be transmitted to CD4 T cells since some HIV-1 virions remain deeply tangled in membrane protrusions and microvilli of the plasma membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Using functional assays that detect virion fusion and productive infection of CD4 T cells, we investigated whether <italic>trans</italic>-infection is mediated through internalized or external HIV-1 virions in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) and CD34-derived Langerhans cells (LCs).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mature MDDCs Transmit HIV-1 to T Cells Primarily via the <italic>trans</italic> Pathway while Immature MDDCs Preferentially Transmit R5-Tropic HIV-1 via the De Novo Pathway</title><p>The potential effects of the state of DC maturation and coreceptor utilization by HIV virions in the <italic>trans</italic> and the de novo pathways in HIV-1 transmission from DCs to T cells were evaluated. These studies were performed with immature MDDCs or MDDCs matured with tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; and poly(I:C) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; and with two laboratory-adapted viral strains, CXCR4-tropic NL4&#x02013;3 and CCR5-tropic 81A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>). MDDCs were incubated with virions at 4 &#x000b0;C to promote viral binding and were then either added to autologous activated T cells immediately or incubated for 1 to 5 d at 37 &#x000b0;C before mixing the autologous T cells. The MDDCs were then incubated with T cells for 24 h to allow virion transfer to T cells. After an additional 2 d of incubation in the presence of azidothymidine (AZT), productive infection of T cells was measured by immunostaining with anti-p24<sup>Gag</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Transmission of 81A (R5-tropic) virions from immature MDDCs to T cells was biphasic, as reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The early phase (0 to 1 d) involved the <italic>trans</italic> pathway; the later phase (1 to 5 d) involved the de novo pathway and was sensitive to the HIV protease inhibitor amprenavir (not shown). During the first day, 25&#x00025; of R5-tropic 81A virions were transmitted by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway; 75&#x00025; were transmitted by the de novo pathway over the ensuing 4 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In mature MDDCs, however, approximately 93&#x00025; of virions were transmitted by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway during the first day. X4-tropic NL4&#x02013;3 virions were transmitted by both immature and mature MDDCs principally by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Similar results were obtained when MDDCs were analyzed from nine different normal donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p><p>In vivo, DCs may not immediately interact with T cells after virion capture. Accordingly, we investigated how a delay in T-cell contact might affect transmission through the <italic>trans</italic> pathway with a virion-based HIV-1 fusion assay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. MDDCs loaded with HIV-1 virions containing &#x003b2;-lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr) were incubated with autologous T cells, and fusion to CD4 T cells was monitored by the changes in fluorescence of CCF2, a BlaM substrate loaded into the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). When NL4&#x02013;3 virions were presented immediately after binding to mature MDDCs, up to 24&#x00025; of CD4 T cells displayed BlaM activity, indicating virion fusion. Transmission was less efficient when virions were presented by immature MDDCs. Fewer 81A than NL4&#x02013;3 virions were transmitted, likely because there were fewer CCR5- than CXCR4-expressing cells in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). When virions were presented by MDDCs after incubation at 37 &#x000b0;C for up to 120 min, transmission efficiency decreased sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>E) in both immature and mature MDDCs. This rapid decrease was not due to a relative lack of sensitivity of the fusion assay in the context of <italic>trans</italic>-infection. As in our previous studies of T-cell infection with free virions, the fusion assay proved to be both sensitive and quantitative over a broad range of viral inputs in these DC&#x02013;T-cell mixing experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030004-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection from MDDCs to autologous CD4 T cells is efficient only for a limited time after virion capture.</p><p>Our results show that immature DCs preferentially transmit R5-tropic HIV-1 by the de novo pathway, as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, and X4-tropic HIV-1 by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Mature DCs transmit both R5- and X4-tropic virions mainly by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Since immature DCs are present at mucosal sites of viral entry, while mature DCs reside in lymph nodes and in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), HIV-1 may exploit different transmission strategies at different anatomic sites in vivo. In healthy mucosa, immature DCs are likely to transmit R5-tropic HIV-1 principally via the de novo pathway, especially since the efficiency of the <italic>trans</italic> pathway declines rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;); the <italic>trans</italic> pathway might contribute to the local spread of virus from mucosal immature DCs to macrophages and CD4 T cells. However, in inflamed mucosal epithelium, which contains a greater proportion of mature DCs, HIV-1 transmission might preferentially involve the <italic>trans</italic> pathway, as in human cervical explants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In lymph nodes and GALT, the proximity of mature DCs to T cells would further favor the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Since DC&#x02013;T-cell conjugates are major sites of HIV-1 production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>trans-</italic>infection could be critical in the intense viral replication that characterizes the acute and chronic phases of untreated HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Neutralizing Surface-Bound Virions on DCs Abrogates <italic>trans</italic>-Infection</title><p>To identify the cellular compartment from which HIV-1 is transmitted <italic>in trans,</italic> we selectively neutralized surface-bound HIV-1 virions with truncated recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4; AIDS Reagent Program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;), which binds the HIV-1 envelope gp120 protein and prevents engagement of CD4 on T cells. Cells were treated at 4 &#x000b0;C to protect internalized virions from sCD4 exposure. NL4&#x02013;3 virions containing BlaM-Vpr were bound to MDDCs and allowed to internalize, and cell-surface virions were neutralized with sCD4. In the absence of an internalization step, surface-bound virions on immature and mature MDDCs effectively fused to CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; bars 1 and 3); this fusion was effectively blocked by sCD4 (bars 2 and 4). However, when HIV-1 virions were internalized at 37 &#x000b0;C for 30 min before treatment (bars 5 to 8), sCD4 still inhibited virion fusion (bars 6 and 8). To confirm that sCD4 neutralized surface-bound virions without impairing subsequent virion transfer, two sets of HIV-1 virions were successively bound to immature MDDCs, but only the first was neutralized with sCD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Similar amounts of HIV-1 fused to T cells regardless of the presence of previously neutralized cell-surface virions on the DCs (bars 3 and 5). Thus, sCD4 does not interfere with virological synapse formation or the transfer of virions bound after sCD4 treatment.</p><p>To further confirm the absence of virion transfer from internal cellular compartments, we performed sequential loading of HIV-1 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP-HIV) and then HIV-1 expressing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (CFP-HIV) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). GFP-HIV was bound to MDDCs and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C to allow virion internalization. Some residual GFP-HIV virions remained at the surface. Next, CFP-HIV was bound but kept at 4 &#x000b0;C to prevent virion internalization. MDDCs were then incubated with autologous T cells for 48 h. sCD4 treatment after binding and internalization of GFP-HIV but before CFP-HIV binding fully blocked transmission of GFP-HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, middle panel), indicating that residual surface-bound GFP-HIV was the source of virus for transmission to T cells (left panel). Under these conditions, CFP-HIV was still transferred to T cells, confirming that sCD4 treatment did not affect subsequent transfer of virions and was not inherently harmful. In the absence of treatment, many double-positive GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were observed, indicating that more than one virion can be transmitted to each T cell (left panel).</p><p>Thus, the neutralization studies showed that only surface-bound, but not internalized, HIV virions mediated <italic>trans</italic>-infection from MDDCs to T cells. sCD4 likely neutralizes HIV-1 virions by competing for viral binding to the CD4 receptor on T cells, as intact HIV-1 virions, including gp120, remained associated with the MDDCs after treatment (unpublished data). Although sCD4 has been reported to allow HIV-1 fusion to cells that do not express CD4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, sCD4 did not induce fusion to CD4<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells in our experiments, as demonstrated by the absence of BlaM transfer to CD8 T cells or B cells (not shown).</p><p>Next, we stripped surface HIV virions from MDDCs by proteolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). GFP-HIV was again allowed to bind and internalize. CFP-HIV was restricted to the surface of MDDCs and served as a control for neutralization by the proteolytic enzymes. MDDCs loaded with GFP-HIV and CFP-HIV were then treated with trypsin as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; or pronase and incubated for 2 d with T cells. Trypsin treatment did not effectively remove externally bound CFP-HIV virions (unpublished data). However, in the presence of increasing amounts of pronase, fewer surface-bound CFP-HIV virions were transmitted to T cells, indicating increasingly effective removal the surface-bound HIV-1 by this protease cocktail. However, pronase had the same effect on the transfer of GFP-HIV, whether it had been internalized or not. Thus, successfully transmitted GFP-HIV virions appear to originate from the cell surface rather than from an internal, pronase-resistant compartment in MDDCs.</p><p>We considered the possibility that the low levels of transmission in the presence of sCD4 could correspond to transmission events from internalized HIV-1, masked under our experimental conditions. However, changes in viral input, internalization time, and viral strains failed to reveal significant transfer from internal compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030004-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). We also studied a second type of DC, LCs derived from CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cord blood cells (MatTek; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mattek.com">http://www.mattek.com</ext-link>). As observed in MDDCs, the transfer of HIV virions from LCs to allogenic T cells again was mediated by virions bound at the surface of the LCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030004-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Since MDDCs and LCs derived from CD34 progenitors are excellent surrogates of in vivo DCs, we conclude that most virions transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> in vivo likely originate from the cell surface.</p><p>These results in MDDCs and LCs sharply contrast with the report that formed the basis for the prevailing model of <italic>trans</italic>-infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In that report, surface-bound virions were neutralized by proteolytic digestion with trypsin. Although in our hands trypsin did not digest surface-bound virions as potently as pronase, the discordance of results likely lies in the use of different reporter systems. Kwon et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; used a luciferase reporter that does not allow the distinction between infection of T cells or MDDCs. Since the immature MDDCs used in that study are highly susceptible to fusion with the R5-tropic BaL envelopes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; and efficiently replicate CCR5-tropic HIV-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, the luciferase activity may have derived from infected immature MDDCs, not T cells, in the coculture. Our flow-based assays, which permit a clear distinction between infection of T cells and MDDCs in coculture, reveal that HIV-1 virions transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> are sensitive to pronase treatment.</p><p>Our results also differ from three later studies, further supporting the notion that HIV infection of T cells by DCs involves the transfer of internalized virions from DCs to interacting CD4 T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. McDonald et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; showed the recruitment of &#x0201c;trypsin-resistant&#x0201d; HIV-1 virions to the immunological synapse; however, functional assays were not performed to confirm that the interacting CD4 T cells were actually infected by the recruited virions. We suspect that, while virions may be transported to the synapse, these virions are not successfully transmitted. Wiley et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; showed the release of infectious virions from HIV-1&#x02013;loaded MDDCs, even after surface-bound virions were removed with trypsin. However, the efficacy of the trypsin treatment was only controlled in the experiments measuring the release of p24<sup>Gag</sup> in the supernatant, not in studies measuring the infectivity of these virions. Finally, Ganesh et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; observed the transfer of some virions from MDDCs to T cells in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, a surprising result in light of our findings with sCD4. In their study, the efficacy of the antibody neutralization was measured with free virions but not with MDDCs bearing only surface-bound HIV-1 virions. The amount of antibody required to neutralize free virions might be lower than the amount needed to neutralize surface-bound virions on MDDCs, a possibility that would explain our divergent results. Of note, our findings are supported by a recent study showing that, in Raji cells expressing DC-SIGN (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin), surface-bound rather than internalized virions are transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> to 293T cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>trans</italic>-Infection in the Context of Superantigen Stimulation</title><p>Several reports have suggested that captured HIV-1 virions are stored in MVBs, raising the possibility that HIV-1 mediates <italic>trans</italic>-infection of T cells by highjacking a pathway involved in the trafficking of internal vesicles to the immunological synapse.

Only T cells of the appropriate antigen specificity trigger this transport. Since antigen recognition could mobilize the release of HIV-1 virions from the MVB, we investigated <italic>trans</italic>-infection in the context of stimulation with a superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>). SEB activates T cells by crosslinking the variable region of T-cell receptor &#x003b2;-chain and the MHC class II molecule expressed on the DC surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>NL4&#x02013;3 virions containing BlaM-Vpr were bound at 4 &#x000b0;C to SEB-pulsed MDDCs. Viral transfer to autologous purified CD4 T cells was measured after allowing virion internalization, or not, by MDDCs. Again, sCD4 completely blocked HIV-1 transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). However, since the fusion assay does not require T-cell activation to generate a positive signal, <italic>trans</italic>-infection could be detected in the absence of engagement of the T-cell receptor and MHC class II. To further ensure that transfer was analyzed only when the MDDCs and T cells were effectively engaged, we measured productive infection of resting T cells by immunostaining for p24<sup>Gag</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Only T cells stimulated by SEB-loaded MDDCs are rendered permissive by releasing a postentry restriction block created by APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Again, the vast majority of transmission events were neutralized by sCD4. However, under these experimental conditions, a few virions were transmitted from an sCD4-resistant compartment, as evidenced by the slight increase in transfer when SEB-loaded MDDCs were allowed to internalize HIV-1 virions at 37 &#x000b0;C. These transmission events were not due to new virion production by MDDCs since similar results were observed when AZT was added after 24 h of coincubation of MDDCs and T cells. When SEB-pulsed MDDCs were allowed to internalize HIV-1 virions for a longer period, HIV-1 virion transfer slightly increased peaking at 1 h of internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Subsequently, the efficiency of transfer from internal compartments decreased, likely as a consequence of degradation or inactivation of the internalized virions.</p><p>In conclusion, HIV-1 virions transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> from DCs to T cells principally originate from the surface of DCs, except during antigen recognition, when a few internalized virions may also be transmitted to the antigen-specific T cells. Whether these rare events contribute to the preferential infection and elimination of HIV-specific T cells in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; is not known. Nevertheless, even within this context, the vast majority of transmitted virions are derived from the surface of DCs. Our results do not challenge the prevailing view that HIV-1 virions are internalized in the DCs. Indeed, we detected large amounts of internalized HIV-1 virions by microscopy. However, unless HIV-1&#x02013;loaded DCs encounter T cells of the appropriate specificity, virion internalization appears to be a dead end for HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection. Since the C-type lectin receptors involved in <italic>trans</italic>-infection are localized in lipid rafts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030004-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, surface-bound HIV-1 likely exploits the clustering of lipid rafts at the immunological synapse to enhance <italic>trans</italic>-infection of CD4 T cells. Because <italic>trans</italic>-infection principally involves surface-bound virions, our findings suggest that attachment inhibitors could be used to limit <italic>trans</italic>-infection of T cells by DCs, in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Two-phase transmission of HIV-1 from MDDCs to autologous T cells.</title><p>To study HIV-1 transmission from DCs to T cells, MDDCs (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were incubated with 81A or NL4&#x02013;3 virions (50 &#x003bc;g of p24<sup>Gag</sup> /ml) for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C, washed four times in cold PBS, incubated for 0 to 5 d at 37 &#x000b0;C, diluted 1:10, and added to autologous phytohemagglutinin-activated PBLs (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>).
