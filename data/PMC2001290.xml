The aim of the study was to proof the concept that virosomes can also be used to elicit high titers of antibodies against synthetic peptides. The specific objective was to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of two virosome-formulated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> protein derived synthetic peptide antigens given in two different doses alone or in combination.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The design was a single blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose-escalating study involving 46 healthy Caucasian volunteers aged 18&#x02013;45 years. Five groups of 8 subjects received virosomal formulations containing 10 &#x000b5;g or 50 &#x000b5;g of AMA 49-CPE, an apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) derived synthetic phospatidylethanolamine (PE)-peptide conjugate or 10 ug or 50 ug of UK39, a circumsporozoite protein (CSP) derived synthetic PE-peptide conjugate or 50 ug of both antigens each. A control group of 6 subjects received unmodified virosomes. Virosomal formulations of the antigens (designated PEV301 and PEV302 for the AMA-1 and the CSP virosomal vaccine, respectively) or unmodified virosomes were injected i. m. on days 0, 60 and 180. In terms of safety, no serious or severe adverse events (AEs) related to the vaccine were observed. 11/46 study participants reported 16 vaccine related local AEs. Of these 16 events, all being pain, 4 occurred after the 1<sup>st</sup>, 7 after the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 5 after the 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination. 6 systemic AEs probably related to the study vaccine were reported after the 1<sup>st</sup> injection, 10 after the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6 after the 3<sup>rd</sup>. Generally, no difference in the distribution of the systemic AEs between either the doses applied (10 respectively 50 &#x000b5;g) or the synthetic antigen vaccines (PEV301 and PEV302) used for immunization was found. In terms of immunogenicity, both PEV301 and PEV302 elicited already after two injections a synthetic peptide-specific antibody response in all volunteers immunized with the appropriate dose. In the case of PEV301 the 50 &#x000b5;g antigen dose was associated with a higher mean antibody titer and seroconversion rate than the 10 &#x000b5;g dose. In contrast, for PEV302 mean titer and seroconversion rate were higher with the lower dose. Combined delivery of PEV301 and PEV302 did not interfere with the development of an antibody response to either of the two antigens. No relevant antibody responses against the two malaria antigens were observed in the control group receiving unmodified virosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that three immunizations with the virosomal malaria vaccine components PEV301 or/and PEV302 (containing 10 &#x000b5;g or 50 &#x000b5;g of antigen) are safe and well tolerated. At appropriate antigen doses seroconversion rates of 100&#x00025; were achieved. Two injections may be sufficient for eliciting an appropriate immune response, at least in individuals with pre-existing anti-malarial immunity. These results justify further development of a final multi-stage virosomal vaccine formulation incorporating additional malaria antigens.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00400101">NCT00400101</ext-link>

The haemagglutinin of the influenza virus is a fusion-inducing membrane glycoprotein, which facilitates antigen delivery to immunocompetent cells. IRIVs represent an universal antigen-delivery system for multi-component subunit vaccines, since antigens can be either attached to their surface to elicit CD4 T cell and antibody responses or encapsulated in their lumen to elicit CD8 T cell responses. They have an excellent safety profile and are already registered for human use, as two virosomal vaccines, the influenza vaccine Inflexal V&#x000ae; and the hepatitis A vaccine Epaxal&#x000ae; are commercialized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Zurbriggen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> More than 20 million doses of Epaxal or Inflexal V have been applied so far.

The safety analysis population listings were made of the safety data collected at each time point.</p><p>The <italic>Per Protocol (PP) immunogenicity analysis population</italic> included all participants, who received the three doses of the allocated product in the allowed intervals and timely attended all the scheduled blood sampling visits. The <italic>Intention-to-treat (ITT) immunogenicity analysis population</italic> included all participants and all time points, independently from protocol deviations (which mainly consisted in a 1&#x02013;2 day deviation from the allowed time interval). Data collected from drop-outs were included for <italic>ITT</italic> analysis until the date of discontinuation.</p><p>The criteria for the evaluation of immunogenicity of PEV301 and PEV302 were the results of antibody titers by Elisa against AMA49-C1 and UK-39. ELISA responders were defined as participants with a minimum titer &#x02265;1&#x02236;500 and a &#x0003e;2 fold increase after immunization.</p><p>The geometric means and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals of the antibody titers determined by ELISA (total IgG) for PEV 301 and PEV 302 in the four different groups were calculated separately for each time point and study group. The statistical significance of the vaccine component effects was tested using a Wilcoxon test to compare the median of the antibody titers between group A (PEV301 10 &#x000b5;g) and 3 (PEV301 50 &#x000b5;g), group A (PEV301 10 &#x000b5;g) and 5 (PEV301&#x00026;302 50 &#x000b5;g) and group C (PEV301 50 &#x000b5;g) and 5 (PEV301&#x00026;302 50 &#x000b5;g) at each study week assessment. Same was done for the respective groups of PEV302. The Fishers exact test was applied to compare the proportion of respondents between the groups above and at each time point with the exception weeks 9/10 and 26/27 where the titre could not be determined.</p><p>Indices of antibody response were expressed as the ratio of the antibody concentration obtained by Elisa at the 4, 12/14 and 29/30 weeks with reference the baseline measurement point. The geometric mean and 95&#x00025; confidence limits were calculated and the Wilcoxon test was used to compare between groups and between the follow-up times at the 4, 12/14 and 29/30 week and the baseline. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Ethics and regulatory bodies</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Ethikkommission beider Basel (EKBB) and the study carried out in full compliance with the international ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human participants and the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice.

Nevertheless, there was a significant difference between the response indices (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001018-g003">figure 3a</xref>) of PEV301 10 &#x000b5;g after the second and third immunization versus that of the IRIV (control group) (both p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.004). Differences in response indices between groups PEV301 50 &#x000b5;g and PEV301 &#x00026; 302 50 &#x000b5;g were not statistically significant at weeks 4, 9/10, 12/14, 26/27 and 29/30 (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.37, 0.37, 0.06, 0.07 and 0.1 respectively), indicating that the combination with PEV302 did not interfere with the response to PEV301. When comparing response indices after the first to the ones after the second immunization in the PEV301 50 &#x000b5;g groups, the difference was borderline significant (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.09) indicating that the initial response was possibly boosted by the second administration. There was no additional benefit of having a third immunization (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.7). All volunteers in the two 50 &#x000b5;g groups had developed an IgG response after the second immunization, whereas 62.5&#x00025; (5/8) of the volunteers in the 10 &#x000b5;g group seroconverted. Importantly, antibody titers evaluated one year after the third immunization had remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001018-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001018-t003">Tab. 3</xref>).</p><p>With PEV302 the highest mean ELISA titers were observed after three injections, versus two for both PEV301 50 &#x000b5;g groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001018-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001018-g002">figure 2</xref>). In contrast to the results with PEV301, mean ELISA endpoint titers of the group receiving 10 &#x000b5;g of the antigen were higher than those receiving 50 &#x000b5;g. Furthermore, all volunteers in the PEV302 10 &#x000b5;g group, but only 11/14 in the two PEV302 50 &#x000b5;g groups had seroconverted after two injections. After the third immunization, all volunteers in the PEV302 10 &#x000b5;g group, but only 11/14 in the two PEV302 50 &#x000b5;g groups reached an ELISA titer &#x0003e;1&#x02236;500. The percentage of volunteers reaching this titer increased with each immunization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001018-t003">Table 3</xref>). Response indices of the three groups receiving PEV302 were not significantly different (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001018-g003">figure 3b</xref>) &#x0005b;comparing group B versus E (combination) p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.79 between screening visit and week 4, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.84 at week 9/10, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.95 at week 12/14, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.79 at week 26/27 and p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.88 at week 29/30, and comparing group D versus E (combination) p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.92 between screening visit and week 4, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.60 at week 9/10, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.34 at week 12/14, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.42 at week 26/27 and p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.28 at week 29/30), demonstrating that the combination of PEV302 with PEV301 did not interfere with the response to PEV302. However, the index of response obtained in the PEV301 &#x00026; 302 50 &#x000b5;g group was higher than that of PEV302 50 &#x000b5;g group at all time points (although not statistically significant), suggesting that the combination with PEV301 may improve the response to PEV302. When comparing response indices after the first to the ones after the second immunization in the 10 &#x000b5;g group, the difference was borderline significant (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.056) indicating that the initial response was boosted by the second administration. There was no significant additional benefit of having a third immunization (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.22). As for PEV301, antibody titers tested one year after the last immunization had remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001018-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001018-t003">Tab. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001018-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001018.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Geometric means of the ratios of geometric mean antibody endpoint titres (log scale) for samples taken three weeks after each immunization with reference to pre-vaccination titers in sera taken at the screening visit (week-1).</title><p>a) anti-AMA49-C1 IgG titers (Group A&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;PEV301 10 &#x000b5;g; Group C&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;PEV301 50 &#x000b5;g; Group E&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;PEV301&#x00026;302 50 &#x000b5;g, Group F&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;IRIV) b) anti-UK-39 IgG titers (Group B&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;PEV302 10 &#x000b5;g; Group D&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;PEV302 50 &#x000b5;g; Group E&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;PEV301&#x00026;302 50 &#x000b5;g, Group F&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;IRIV)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001018.g003"/></fig><p>In contrast to PEV301 and PEV302, no significant ELISA endpoint titers and response indices were observed against the malaria antigens in the control participants receiving IRIVs only.

The results presented in this paper prove the relevance and the feasibility of the concept: i) GMP formulated material can be easily and quickly manufactured, ii) the vaccine formulation is safe, and iii) the vaccine formulation is immunogenic leading to seroconversion of all volunteers after two injections with an appropriate antigen dose.</p><p>In terms of safety, the antigen delivery platform (IRIVs) used for the tested vaccines is already commercialized and has been given to &#x0223c;20 million people, including children and infants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Mayorga1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> This safety record is a major advance, since, the two malaria vaccines that have shown some efficacy in Phase IIb trials in endemic areas are formulated in adjuvants that have been given at best to only a few thousands of subjects so far.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Alonso1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Genton1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> Also, although probably safe, these new adjuvants are quite reactogenic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Aguado1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Pink1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> As with other vaccine types, rare serious adverse events have been reported following immunizations with synthetic malaria peptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Kashala1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, but these may have occurred, because the doses of antigen were too high for the potent adjuvant used. Since the two synthetic antigens used in the present study were applied in lower doses and combined with the human approved IRIVs we expected an excellent safety profile. This was confirmed by our results that showed that the virosome-formulated PE-peptide conjugates AMA49-C1 and UK-39 as well as the combination of both are safe. The local reactogenicity was minimal with only mild or moderate pain, and no redness or swelling. This contrasts with results obtained in Phase I trials with recombinant malaria proteins formulated with ASO2A or Montanide ISA 720, or DNA vaccines in viral vectors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Pink1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> There was no difference in the incidence rate and intensity of AEs between the participants given one or the other synthetic antigen, or both, and between the two doses, which proves the safety of the formulation.</p><p>In terms of immunogenicity, the ELISA results demonstrate that the formulation of synthetic peptides with virosomes elicited a response in all volunteers immunized with an appropriate dose. These results represent a proof of principle, i.e. they demonstrate that virosomes are a suitable antigen delivery system for malaria peptide antigens in humans and that immunogenetic restriction of the response does not represent a serious limitation for this approach. In the majority of volunteers immunized with PEV302, we observed cross-reactivity with the target proteins on the cell surface of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites (data not shown). Also in the case of a minority of PEV301 immunized volunteers development of an AMA-1 specific staining pattern of malaria blood stage parasites was found in spite of variable background staining. These results demonstrate that the two synthetic antigens display the native structure of antigenic domains of the target antigens AMA-1 and CSP.</p><p>In the case of PEV301, the higher antigen dose (50 &#x000b5;g) was significantly superior to the lower dose (10 &#x000b5;g) with respect to mean antibody titers and seroconversion rate. For PEV302, the trend was reverse. These results may imply that additional antigens included in a multivalent vaccine will need a proper dose-finding assessment. In the case of PEV301 and PEV302 trends observed in animal immunogenicity studies and the clinical trial were comparable (Mueller et al., unpublished). Since the combined delivery of PEV301 and PEV302 did not interfere with the development of an immune response to either of the two components, it is hoped that the inclusion of additional antigens should not be detrimental to the overall immunogenicity. In addition, a persistent antibody titer was measured after one year.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>This trial was performed in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve Caucasian adult participants. The safety profile of this vaccine formulation is likely to be quite similar when administered to children living in malaria endemic areas. Indeed, it has been regularly observed that the incidence of adverse events is lower in populations with pre-existing immunity rather than higher. Moreover, IRIV have already been successfully used as immunomodulators with antigens other than malaria in developing countries. In terms of immunogenicity, the 100&#x00025; seroconversion rate achieved in malaria na&#x000ef;ve volunteers already after only two injections with the appropriate dose of antigen is highly promising. Indeed, it is expected that the vaccine will boost pre-existing immunity and the net result should be higher immune responses in populations with natural exposure. The observation of very high antibody titers after vaccination in one volunteer that had some degree of preexisting malaria immunity at the start (and therefore wrongly included) is quite promising in this respect and justifies the planning of a Phase Ib trial in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>Influenza virosomes represent an innovative human-compatible antigen delivery system that has already proven its suitability for vaccine design, such as for hepatitis A and influenza vaccines that are commercialized in many countries in the world (also for children). The present trial is the first to test the safety and immunogenicity of virosomes as carrier/adjuvant system for synthetic peptides of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> in humans. The excellent safety profile is in line with that observed with other virosome-formulated commercialized vaccines, and should argue for an excellent acceptability by the parents. The magnitude of the antibody responses obtained in the present trial confirm previous data from animal studies with virosome-formulated malarial antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001018-Okitsu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and from human studies with antigens other than malaria. The observation that antibody responses were sustained one year after vaccination, and their avidity increased over the course of immunization (unpublished results) demonstrates the appropriateness of this technology platform. These findings justify thus the ongoing efforts to develop a virosome-formulated multi-valent multi-stage malaria vaccine. Our approach of developing optimized IRIV-formulated synthetic peptide vaccines should be generally applicable and amenable for other infectious and non-infectious diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001018.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001018.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001018.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.33 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001018.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We deeply thank the study clinical team (Luisa Baselgia, Claudia Bl&#x000e4;si, Susanne Zehnder), the study participants and the monitors (C.
