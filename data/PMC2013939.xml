AMA1-C1 contains an equal mixture of yeast-expressed recombinant proteins based on sequences from the FVO and 3D7 clones of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, adsorbed on Alhydrogel. The control vaccine was the hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax). Participants were enrolled into 1 of 3 dose cohorts (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;18 per cohort) and randomized 2&#x02236;1 to receive either AMA1-C1 or Recombivax. Participants in the first, second, and third cohorts randomized to receive AMA1-C1 were vaccinated with 5, 20 and 80 &#x000b5;g of AMA1-C1, respectively. Vaccinations were administered on days 0, 28, and 360, and participants were followed until 6 months after the final vaccination. AMA1-C1 was well tolerated; no vaccine-related severe or serious adverse events were observed. AMA1 antibody responses to the 80 &#x000b5;g dose increased rapidly from baseline levels by days 14 and 28 after the first vaccination and continued to increase after the second vaccination. After a peak 14 days following the second vaccination, antibody levels decreased to baseline levels one year later at the time of the third vaccination that induced little or no increase in antibody levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the AMA1-C1 vaccine candidate was well-tolerated and induced antibody responses to both vaccine and non-vaccine alleles, the antibody response after a third dose given at one year was lower than the response to the initial vaccinations.

Greater antibody responses were seen after the third vaccination than after the first two vaccinations. No significant difference was observed in the antibody responses to the two highest dose concentrations tested (20 and 80 &#x000b5;g), although both were significantly higher than the lowest dose tested (5 &#x000b5;g), suggesting that a maximum response had been attained in this study population.</p><p>Due to these promising results, a clinical trial of the AMA1-C1 vaccine was performed in Mali, West Africa. The results of this study demonstrate that the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel vaccine induces a significant humoral immune response in malaria-exposed individuals even after a single dose of vaccine that increases after a second vaccination given one month following the first. Surprisingly, administration of a third vaccination one year following the initial vaccinations did not result in increased antibody levels similar to those seen after the first two vaccinations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001045.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001045.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Site</title><p>The study was conducted in Don&#x000e9;gu&#x000e9;bougou, Mali, at a clinic operated by the Malaria Research and Training Center of the University of Bamako.

Each 0.5 mL dose contained either 5, 20, or 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1-C1 and 800 &#x000b5;g Alhydrogel. Potency studies in mice conducted every 6 months confirmed that all lots were stable and potent throughout the trial. Recombivax HB (Merck&#x00026;Co.) was supplied in single-dose vials containing 10 &#x000b5;g of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen adsorbed to amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate at a final volume of 1.0 mL.

Injection sites were examined for erythema, swelling, and tenderness at the site of injection. Solicited systemic adverse events included fever or chills, headache, nausea, myalgia, and arthralgia. Adverse events were graded as either mild (easily tolerated), moderate (interfered with activities of daily living), or severe (prevented activities of daily living), and assigned causality relative to the study vaccine. Injection site erythema and swelling were graded as mild (&#x0003e;0 to &#x02264;20 mm in diameter), moderate (&#x0003e;20 to &#x02264;50 mm), or severe (&#x0003e;50 mm). Oral temperature was graded as mild (&#x0003e;37.5&#x000b0;C to&#x02264;38.0&#x000b0;C), moderate (&#x0003e;38.0&#x000b0;C to&#x02264;39.0&#x000b0;C), or severe (&#x0003e;39.0&#x000b0;C). A complete blood count, serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase concentration were performed immediately prior to each vaccination as well on the third and fourteenth days following vaccination.

Mouse anti-human IgG subclass antibodies (anti-human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) and a secondary donkey anti-mouse IgG phycoerythrin-labeled antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added to develop the reactions. Mean fluorescence intensities were detected by Luminex X-MAP using Bioplex software (BioRad).</p><p>IgG from vaccinated individuals were tested for their ability to inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 and FVO parasites using a standardized GIA procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Malkin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Trager1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

A group size of 10 individuals would provide a power of 80&#x00025; to detect an adverse event that occurs with a probability of 0.15; an extra 2 participants were recruited into each group in case of withdrawal or loss to follow-up.</p><p>In addition, each dose concentration of AMA1-C1 was compared to Recombivax, which served as a comparison for both immunologic and safety assessments. A total of 18 controls, 6 per each dose concentration of AMA1-C1, were enrolled to allow a 2&#x02236;1 ratio of AMA1-C1 to Recombivax within each cohort; thus, each of the 3 cohorts contained 12 volunteers receiving AMA1-C1 plus 6 receiving Recombivax for a total sample size of 54.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomization</title><p>Within each cohort, participants were randomized to receive either AMA1-C1 or Recombivax by use of sealed envelopes labeled with a unique participant study number and containing the vaccine assignment. A set of 18 envelopes were prepared for each cohort such that 12 contained assignments to AMA1-C1 and 6 to Recombivax. Study numbers were assigned in the order that participants arrived at the clinic on the day of first immunization. Randomization envelopes were opened by a study pharmacist on the day of first immunization and immediately re-sealed after vaccine assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Blinding</title><p>Study participants and investigators who assessed outcomes were blinded to vaccine assignment. Access to randomization codes was limited to the study pharmacists. Syringe barrels were masked with opaque tape to disguise the contents, since the volumes of the two study vaccines were different.

The exact two-sided Cochrane-Armitage test for trend using rank scores was used to test for a dose effect for each solicited adverse event; for these analyses, the Recombivax group was assigned a dose of 0 &#x000b5;g of AMA1-C1.</p><p>Differences in the change in antibody level from baseline to post-vaccination time points were compared between AMA1-C1 and Recombivax using exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests within each cohort. Differences in change of antibody (days 0 and 42) between dose groups were analyzed using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, assuming the absence of an effect due to differing vaccination times for the cohorts in relation to the malaria transmission season (this assumption was not violated by a Kruskal-Wallis test for cohort effect on day 0 values &#x0005b;<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.4&#x0005d;).

All other participants received all planned vaccinations and completed all scheduled study visits, and were included in all analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Safety</title><p>All vaccinations were well tolerated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001045-t001">Table 1</xref>). Mild pain and swelling were the most commonly observed injection site reactions, and there were no significant differences among the proportions of volunteers with these reactions between vaccines (AMA1-C1 vs. Recombivax) or between vaccinations within dose groups.

To investigate to what extent growth inhibition observed in individual sera was due to anti-AMA1 antibodies, day 42 samples from four individuals with high levels of anti-AMA1 antibody (one from each of the AMA1-C1 dose groups and one from the Recombivax group) were pre-incubated with AMA1 protein; minimal to no reversal of invasion inhibition was seen (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The results of this trial indicate that the AMA1-C1 blood-stage malaria vaccine adjuvanted with Alhydrogel is well-tolerated when administered to adult malaria-exposed volunteers living in Mali, does not result in significant vaccination-related adverse events, and induces significant anti-AMA1 antibody responses in this population. Significant responses were observed even after administration of a single 80 &#x000b5;g dose, suggesting that boosting of pre-existing immunity from prior exposure to natural infection is possible with this vaccine.</p><p>Given that the proposed mechanism of action of blood-stage malaria vaccines is through production of antibody against malarial antigens expressed on the surface of merozoites or infected erythrocytes, an important objective of this study was to test the ability of the AMA1-C1 vaccine to induce humoral immune responses in malaria-experienced individuals. Not surprisingly, pre-existing levels of anti-AMA1 antibodies were found in most study participants prior to vaccination, likely due to previous exposure to this antigen by natural infection. While vaccination with either Recombivax or 5 &#x000b5;g AMA1-C1 induced no significant increase in anti-AMA1 antibodies, a significant increase in responses to both AMA1-3D7 and AMA1-FVO was detectable after just one dose of 80 &#x000b5;g AMA1-C1 in the Malian volunteers.</p><p>However, the antibody response to vaccination with AMA1-C1 adjuvanted with Alhydrogel in semi-immune Malian adults differed from that observed in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults in the US. In US volunteers, a recall response was induced upon vaccinating five months after the second vaccination although minimal levels of antibody were seen after the first two vaccinations regardless of dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Malkin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In the Malian study, levels of AMA1-specific antibody increased after the first and second vaccinations in a dose dependent fashion, suggesting stimulation of antigen specific memory cells. However, only small increases in antibody were induced after a third vaccination of Malian adults administered one year later. Why did Malians who responded to the first two vaccinations, respond poorly to the third vaccination?</p><p>The first possibility is that the AMA1-C1 vaccine had lost potency either through degradation over time or because of inadequate transportation or storage conditions. However, this is unlikely, as biannual potency studies of the lots of vaccine used in this trial demonstrated continued ability to induce antigen-specific antibodies in animals. Damage during storage or transport is also unlikely because electronic temperature monitors recorded no temperature excursions. Furthermore, study participants who received the Recombivax vaccine, which was transported and stored in the same shipments, developed significant anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibodies after the third vaccination.</p><p>The second possibility is that people living in malaria endemic areas do not generate long-lived B cell memory to AMA1. Arguing against this is the fact that some volunteers responded rapidly to the first vaccination with recall-like kinetics, indicating pre-existing B cell memory to AMA1 due to prior exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Moreover, the vaccine itself was able to induce and recall memory B cells in vaccinated individuals living in the US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Malkin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>What are the possible immunological mechanisms that might account for this effect? First, the Malian volunteers had naturally acquired circulating AMA1-specific antibodies prior to vaccination unlike the US volunteers who had none. It is therefore possible that immune complex formation in Malians resulted in Fc-mediated inhibition of B cells via Fc&#x003b3;IIB receptor, a major negative regulator of B cell activation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Nimmerjahn1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> or resulted in masking of important B cell epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Siegrist1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the Malian volunteers were exposed to malaria infections following vaccination, unlike their American counterparts. Data from a murine malaria model has shown that vaccination with MSP1<sub>19</sub>, another blood-stage antigen, followed by infection with <italic>P. yoelii</italic>, leads to apoptosis of MSP1-specific memory B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Wykes1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, malaria antigen-specific memory B cells may undergo deletion, possibly through apoptosis, upon repeated infection with the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Wykes1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Wykes2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, further study of the development of B cell memory responses to malaria antigens such as AMA1 is necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>In this study, the AMA1-C1 malaria vaccine was well-tolerated and did not induce significant vaccine-related adverse events in malaria-exposed adults; however, any successful blood-stage malaria vaccine will be targeted primarily at infants and young children living in endemic areas since they bear the brunt of the morbidity and mortality due to this disease. Additional trials will therefore be required to establish safety in these age groups prior to initiation of larger efficacy studies. Furthermore, responses to vaccination with AMA1-C1 may be quite different in infants and young children living in endemic areas who have not been exposed to the antigen to the same extent as the semi-immune adults enrolled in the current study, especially considering the hypothesis that pre-existing anti-malarial antibodies might inhibit B cell activation as described above. Indeed, results from clinical trials of the RTS,S malaria vaccine indicate that humoral immune responses are lower in malaria-exposed adults than in malaria-exposed young children or malaria-naive adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Bojang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Alonso1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although there is considerable animal and human data supporting the development of AMA1 as a vaccine, a potential complication is the significant sequence polymorphism seen in strains isolated from different sites around the world. AMA1 has a minimum of 107 different haplotypes at the amino acid level (J Mu and LH Miller, unpublished data). Evidence that this polymorphism might affect vaccine efficacy comes from animal studies showing that rabbits immunized with one AMA1 haplotype produce antibodies that preferentially recognize homologous antigen, with reduced responses to heterologous AMA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. To overcome this potential obstacle to vaccine efficacy, AMA1-C1 incorporates both the 3D7 and FVO alleles of the protein in an attempt to elicit a broader immune response than that achievable by vaccination with either component alone. Whether recipients of the vaccine will be protected against parasites with polymorphic sequences (e.g., L32) remains to be determined.</p><p>In the current study, no association was seen between the significant increase in anti-AMA1 antibodies after the second vaccination with the 80 &#x000b5;g dose of AMA1-C1 and change in GIA activity. There are several potential reasons for this. First, pre-vaccination sera for most AMA1-C1 recipients displayed significant levels of growth inhibition, likely due to antibodies to a host of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens induced by prior infections. The presence of antibodies to non-AMA1 antigens and the small number of participants in our study make interpretation of these GIA results difficult. However, preliminary evidence for the in vitro growth inhibition activity in these individuals being unrelated to antibody against AMA1 is the finding that in a subset of four post-vaccination serum samples with high levels of anti-AMA1 antibody, pre-incubation with AMA1 antigen failed to reverse growth inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>In the first clinical trial of an AMA1 vaccine in an endemic area, the AMA1-C1 vaccine was safe when administered to malaria-exposed adults and, at the highest dose, was able to induce significant immune responses against the individual vaccine components as well as against a heterologous AMA1 allele. Improvements in the vaccine can clearly be made in order to elicit responses more likely to be sustained and protective, as individuals in the high-dose group who responded strongly after the first two vaccinations had minimal or no rise in AMA1-specific antibody levels after the third vaccination, and induction of antibody failed to translate into any significant increase in in vitro growth inhibition of the parasite. Different formulations of this vaccine&#x02013;such as the addition of CpG oligodeoxynucleotideates or conjugate carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Mullen1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001045-Wu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;may overcome these limitations and result in induced antibody responses that are sufficient to impact parasite replication both in vitro and in vaccinated individuals. AMA1-C1 may nonetheless be a promising blood stage vaccine candidate, but further evidence is required from additional clinical trials, including studies conducted in children living in malaria-endemic areas.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
