As epigenetic alterations are common to breast cancer, in this proof-of-concept study demethylating hydralazine, plus the HDAC inhibitor magnesium valproate, were added to neoadjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in locally advanced breast cancer to assess their safety and biological efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>This was a single-arm interventional trial on breast cancer patients &#x00028;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00395655&#x00029;. After signing informed consent, patients were typed for acetylator phenotype and then treated with hydralazine at 182 mg for rapid-, or 83 mg for slow-acetylators, and magnesium valproate at 30 mg/kg, starting from day &#x02013;7 until chemotherapy ended, the latter consisting of four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 21 days.

In counterpoint to genetic defects, the reversible nature of epigenetic aberrations constitutes an attractive therapeutic target; hence, a number of DNA methylation and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are undergoing preclinical testing in combination for cancer therapy because it is clear that these drugs exert a synergistic effect on gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Cameron1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Li1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Primeau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Bovenzi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, preclinical reports have underscored that DNA methylation and HDAC inhibitors also possess the ability to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Karagiannis1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Sonnemann1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it is known that chemotherapy resistance&#x02015;either innate or acquired&#x02015;requires expression changes in a large number of genes for its development; therefore, it has been hypothesized that epigenetic-mediated changes could be the responsible driving force for chemotherapy resistance; thus, epigenetic therapy has the potential to revert chemotherapy resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-PrezPlasencia1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In breast cancer, there is substantial evidence demonstrating the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in transcriptional regulation of critical tumor suppressor and growth regulatory genes. These genes include those that play crucial roles in DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, cell growth, and cell-cell adhesion, which can all contribute to breast cancer tumorigenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Huang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000098-Shi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Afterward, patients began treatment (day &#x02013;7) with a daily dose of a slow-release formulation of hydralazine tablets containing either 182 mg for rapid-acetylators or 83 mg for slow-acetylators. Magnesium valproate tablets of 700 mg were also administered as a slow-release formulation at a dose of 30 mg/Kb t.i.d. Both hydralazine and magnesium valproate were administered from day &#x02013;7 until the last day of the fourth chemotherapy cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Chemotherapy</title><p>Chemotherapy consisted of four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day 1 every 21 days. Antiemetic premedication was intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone 16 mg and ondansetron 16 mg.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Therapy duration and dose modifications</title><p>Patients received hydralazine and magnesium valproate until the last chemotherapy cycle, and were discontinued if the patient was unable to tolerate these despite dose modification, if the patient developed concurrent illness, or if the patient underwent changes in medical condition rendering them unacceptable for further treatment. Chemotherapy administration was delayed for 1 or 2 weeks in the event of any grade 3 or 4 hematological and non-hematological toxicity. In all these cases, however, hydralazine and magnesium valproate were continued. Only the dose of magnesium valproate was reduced 25&#x00025; for grade 3 drowsiness, and was continued at the reduced level throughout the ensuing chemotherapy treatment. Routine or prophylactic use of colony stimulating factors was not allowed during treatment. Nonetheless, growth factor support was permitted to treat a neutropenic event. If the disease progressed during pre-operative therapy, chemotherapy was discontinued and patients underwent immediate surgery or radiation therapy. After final clinical-response assessment, patients were required to be operated on between 14 and 28 days after the last chemotherapy application. Thereafter, all patients received standard radiotherapy of the remaining breast tissue or to the chest wall. Adjuvant weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was administered for 12 weeks in patients with positive nodes after surgery. HER2-positive patients also received adjuvant trastuzumab. Tamoxifen 20 mg/day was administered in estrogen receptor-positive patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Assessment</title><p>Baseline work-up included a complete history and physical examination, bilateral mammography and sonography of the breast, chest x-ray, liver ultrasound (US), and bone scintigraphy. Histologically, the tumor was evaluated with Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading; HER2 and hormone receptors were assayed by immunohistochemistry. Laboratory assessment consisted of complete blood cell count and blood chemistry. Tumor assessment was performed within 2 weeks prior to initiation of transcriptional therapy. Clinical evaluation of palpable tumor and lymph nodes was repeated before each cycle and before surgery.</p><p>The primary end-points were to evaluate the safety of cytotoxic chemotherapy associated with hydralazine and magnesium valproate, as well as to evaluate changes in DNA methylation, HDAC inhibition and global gene expression before and after treatment. The secondary end-point was to evaluate clinical and pathological response after the fourth chemotherapy course. Clinical complete response (CR) response was defined as complete disappearance of all tumor signs in the breast and was assessed by both palpation and by the most appropriate imaging method. Partial response (PR) was defined as a reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters of primary-tumor size by 50&#x00025; or more. In patients with multifocal or multicentric disease, solely the lesion with the largest diameter was assessed. Stable disease (SD) was defined as no significant increase or decrease in tumor size, and progressive disease was defined as the development of new, previously undetected lesions or &#x02265;25&#x00025; increase in the size of a pre-existing lesion. Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no microscopic evidence of residual viable tumor cells in breast and axillary lymph nodes. Toxicity during chemotherapy was evaluated according to common toxicity criteria (CTC) of National Cancer Institute (NCI) version 2.0.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Clinical samples</title><p>Core-needle biopsies were taken from primary breast tumors at diagnosis and after 7 days of treatment with hydralazine and magnesium valproate prior to the first course of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide.

Gene expression differences induced by epigenetic treatment were analyzed by comparing pre- and post-treated clinical samples versus normal breast serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries obtained from the SAGE public website. We included only libraries obtained from normal tissues and with a total amount of sequenced tags. Median expression values for each tag were calculated. To avoid errors in matching tag to Unigene cluster, we considered only tags of &#x0003e;30,000 for which a unique Unigene cluster match was found. To reduce redundancy due to different cluster ID-associated tags, we eliminated these repetitive Unigene IDs. Data values for each sample were normalized between the two platforms against the median of normal breast SAGE libraries, and Log2-based expression ratios were obtained. As unsupervised analysis, we performed hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses to group genes and samples on the basis of their similarities in expression as an initial analysis. An average linkage hierarchical-clustering technique was used in which the measurement of similarity was Spearman rank correlation among the samples' transcription profiles. Log-2 expression ratios were filtered to find genes with a 3-fold minimum expression ratio.

The only toxicity that could be attributed to the experimental therapy&#x02015;specifically, to valproate&#x02015;was drowsiness in the majority of patients; however, this was grades 1 and 2, which by definition do not interfere with patient functioning in daily living.
